        "Cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) is secreted by the choroid plexuses, around the cerebral vessels, and along  the walls of the ventricles of  the brain. It fills the ventricles and cisternae, bathes the spinal cord, and is reabsorbed into the blood  through the arachnoid villi. CSF  turnover is rapid, exchanging about four times per day.     The permeability of the blood-brain barrier to plasma proteins is increased by high intracranial  pressure due to brain tumor; intracerebral  hemorrhage; traumatic injury; or by inflammation due to bacterial or viral  meningitis, encephalitis, or poliomyelitis.     Increased intrathecal synthesis of immunoglobulins, particularly IgG, is seen in demyelinating diseases of  the central nervous system (CNS), especially  multiple sclerosis. Increased immunoglobulins are also   seen in other chronic inflammatory diseases of the CNS such as chronic meningoencephalitis due to  bacteria, viruses, fungi or parasites;  subacute sclerosing panencephalitis; and Guillian-Barre syndrome."
