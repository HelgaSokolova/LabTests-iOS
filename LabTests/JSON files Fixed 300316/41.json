        "Triglycerides are esters of the trihydric alcohol glycerol with 3  long-chain fatty acids. They are partly synthesized in the liver  and partly derived from the diet.  Increased plasma triglyceride levels are indicative of a metabolic  abnormality and, along with elevated cholesterol, are considered  a risk factor for atherosclerotic disease. Hyperlipidemia may be  inherited or be associated with biliary obstruction, diabetes mellitus,  nephrotic syndrome, renal failure, or metabolic disorders related  to endocrinopathies. Increased triglycerides may also be medication-induced (eg, prednisone)."
