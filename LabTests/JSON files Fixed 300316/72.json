        "Fibrinogen, also known as factor I, is a plasma protein that can be  transformed by thrombin into a fibrin gel (the clot).    Fibrinogen is synthesized in the liver and circulates in the plasma  as a disulfide-bonded dimer of three subunit chains.    The biological half-life of plasma fibrinogen is 3-5 days.    An isolated deficiency of fibrinogen may be inherited as an autosomal  recessive trait (afibrinogenemia or hypofibrinogenemia) and is one of  the rarest of the inherited coagulation factor deficiencies.    Acquired causes of decreased fibrinogen levels include: acute or  decompensated intravascular coagulation and fibrinolysis (disseminated  intravascular coagulation), advanced liver disease, L-asparaginase   therapy, and therapy with fibrinolytic agents (e.g., streptokinase,  urokinase, tissue plasminogen activator).      Fibrinogen function abnormalities, dysfibrinogenemias, may be  inherited (congenital) or acquired. Patients with dysfibrinogenemia  are generally asymptomatic. However, the congenital dysfibrinogenemias  are more likely than the acquired to be associated with bleeding or  thrombotic disorders. While the dysfibrinogenemias are generally  not associated with clinically significant hemostasis problems, they  characteristically produce a prolonged thrombin time clotting test.  Congenital dysfibrinogenemias usually are inherited as autosomal  co-dominant traits.    Acquired dysfibrinogenemias mainly occur in association with liver  disease (e.g., chronic hepatitis, hepatoma) or renal diseases  (e.g., chronic glomerulonephritis, hypernephroma) and usually are  associated with elevated fibrinogen levels."
