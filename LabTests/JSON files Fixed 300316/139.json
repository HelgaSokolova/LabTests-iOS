        "Carbamazepine is used in the control of  partial seizures with both temporal lobe and psychomotor symptoms, and for  generalized tonic-clonic seizures. It is also used for analgesia in trigeminal   neuralgia.      Carbamazepine exhibits a volume of distribution of 1.4 L/kg with an elimination  half-life of 15 hours. Protein binding averages 75%.      Aplastic anemia and agranulocytosis are rare side effects of treatment with carbamazepine; baseline  hematologic data should be documented before treatment is initiated.     Toxicity associated with carbamazepine overdose occurs when the blood level is ≥ 12 µg/mL and  is typified by irregular breathing, muscle  irritability, and hyperreflexia; followed by hyporeflexia, tachycardia, hypotension, and impaired  consciousness with coma in severe  toxicity. The higher the blood level, the more severe the symptoms."
