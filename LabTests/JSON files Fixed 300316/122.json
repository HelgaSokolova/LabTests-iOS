CA 19-9 may be elevated in patients with  gastrointestinal malignancies  such as cholangiocarcinoma, pancreatic cancer, or colon cancer.  CA 19-9 is neither specific nor sensitive  enough to be used as a cancer  screen.     Some individuals do not express CA 19-9. Consequently low values in these  individuals are not informative regarding cancer recurrence.      Some patients who have been exposed to animal antigens, either in the  environment or as part of treatment or imaging procedures, may have circulating antianimal antibodies  present. These antibodies  may interfere with the assay reagents to produce unreliable results."
