        "Lithium alters the intraneuronal metabolism of catecholamines by an unknown mechanism. It is used to  suppress the manic phase of manic-depressive  psychosis.       Lithium is distributed throughout the total water spaces of the body and is excreted primarily by the  kidney.       Toxicity from lithium salts leads to ataxia, slurred speech, and confusion.  Since the  concentration of lithium in the serum varies with  the time after the dose, blood for lithium determination (trough values) should be drawn at a standard  time, preferably 8-12 hours after  the last dose."
