        "Creatine Kinase (CK) activity is greatest in striated muscle, heart tissue,  and brain. The determination of CK activity is a proven tool in the   investigation of skeletal muscle disease (muscular dystrophy) and  is also useful in the diagnosis of myocardial infarction (MI) and  cerebrovascular accidents. Increased levels of CK also can be found  in viral myositis, polymyositis, and hypothyroidism.  Following injury to the myocardium, such as occurs in acute MI, CK is  released from the damaged myocardial cells. A rise in the CK activity  can be found 4-8 hours after an infarction. CK activity reaches a  maximum after 12-24 hours and then falls back to the normal range after  3-4 days."
