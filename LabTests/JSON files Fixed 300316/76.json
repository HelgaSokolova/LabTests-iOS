Additional conditions under which the test may be performed: Anemia of chronic disease, Clinical hemoglobin C, Diabetes, Drug-induced immune hemolytic anemia, Giant cell (temporal, cranial) arteritis, Hemolytic anemia due to G6PD deficiency, Idiopathic aplastic anemia, Idiopathic autoimmune hemolytic anemia,Immune hemolytic anemia, Iron deficiency anemia, Paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria (PCH, Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), Pernicious anemia, Placenta abruptio, Polymyalgia rheumatica, Rhabdomyolysis, Secondary aplastic anemia and many more."
