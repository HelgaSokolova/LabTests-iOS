        "Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is a glycoprotein with 2  noncovalently bound subunits. The alpha subunit is similar to those  of luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and  thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). The beta subunit of hCG differs  from other pituitary glycoprotein hormones, which results in its unique  biochemical and immunological properties.    hCG is synthesized by the cells of the placenta and is involved in  maintaining the corpus luteum during pregnancy. It is detected as  early as 1 week after conception. The reference value for a positive  pregnancy test is >25 IU/L. In pregnancy, the levels of hCG increase  exponentially for about 8 to 10 weeks after the last menstrual cycle.  Later in pregnancy, about 12 weeks after conception, the  concentration of hCG begins to fall.    Other sources of elevated hCG values include ectopic pregnancy,  threatened abortion, microabortion, recent termination of  pregnancy, gestational trophoblastic disease, choriocarcinoma  and some germ cell tumors."

        "Values >25 IU/L are consistent with pregnancy. Suggest repeat testing  of indeterminate results in 72 hours. Values in pregnancy should double  every 3 days for the first 6 weeks.    Both normal and ectopic pregnancies generally yield positive  results of pregnancy tests. The comparison of quantitative hCG  measurements with the results of transvaginal ultrasonography  (TVUS) may aid in the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy. When an  embryo is first large enough for the gestation sac to be visible on  TVUS, the patient generally will have hCG concentrations between  1,000 and 2,000 IU/L.  If the  hCG value is this high and no sac is visible in the uterus, ectopic  pregnancy is suggested. Elevated values will also be seen in  choriocarcinoma and hydatiform mole."
