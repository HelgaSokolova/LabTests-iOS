        "In monitoring studies, elevated levels of  CA-125 (>35 U/mL) are a predictor  of the presence of intraperitoneal tumor or recurrence. Elevated concentrations have been  found in about 72% of patients   with surgically proven recurrent ovarian carcinoma. However, normal levels do not rule out  recurrence.     A persistently rising CA-125 value suggests progressive malignant disease and  poor therapeutic response.     Physiologic half-life of CA-125 is approximately 5 days.     In patients with advanced disease who have undergone cytoreductive surgery and are on  chemotherapy, a prolonged half-life  (>20 days) may be associated with a shortened disease-free survival."
