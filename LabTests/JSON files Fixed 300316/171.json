        "This test detects the presence of overt proteinuria  (>300 mg/day). However, normal urinary protein excretion is <30 mg/day.  The presence of microalbuminuria (30-300 mg/day) is not detected by this  method. Overt proteinuria is seen in both renal (glomerulonephritis, renal  tubular diseases, pyelonephritis) and nonrenal diseases (eg, myeloma,  congestive heart failure, dehydration).  False-positive results may be obtained with highly buffered or alkaline urines.  Contamination of the urine specimen with quaternary ammonium compounds (eg,  from some antiseptics and detergents) or with skin cleansers containing  chlorhexidine also may produce false-positive results. Microalbumin tests are  necessary to pick up early increases in urine protein excretion."
