        "Magnesium along with potassium is a major intracellular cation.   Magnesium is a cofactor of many enzyme systems. All adenosine  triphosphate (ATP)-dependent enzymatic reactions require magnesium   as a cofactor. Approximately 70% of magnesium ions are stored in bone.   The remainder is involved in intermediary metabolic processes; about  70% is present in free form while the other 30% is bound to proteins   (especially albumin), citrates, phosphate, and other complex formers.   The serum magnesium level is kept constant within very narrow limits.   Regulation takes place mainly via the kidneys, primarily via the   ascending loop of Henle.  Conditions that interfere with glomerular filtration result in retention of   magnesium and hence elevation of serum concentrations.   Hypermagnesemia is found in acute and chronic renal failure,  magnesium overload, and magnesium release from the intracellular  space. Mild-to-moderate hypermagnesemia may prolong atrioventricular  conduction time. Magnesium toxicity may result in central nervous system  (CNS) depression, cardiac arrest, and respiratory arrest.  Numerous studies have shown a correlation between magnesium  deficiency and changes in calcium-, potassium-, and phosphate-homeostasis which are associated with cardiac disorders such as  ventricular arrhythmias that cannot be treated by conventional therapy,  increased sensitivity to digoxin, coronary artery spasms, and sudden  death. Additional concurrent symptoms include neuromuscular and   neuropsychiatric disorders. Conditions that have been associated with  hypomagnesemia include chronic alcoholism, childhood malnutrition, lactation, malabsorption, acute pancreatitis, hypothyroidism, chronic   glomerulonephritis, aldosteronism, and prolonged intravenous feeding."
