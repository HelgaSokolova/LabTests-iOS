        "Thyroglobulin autoantibodies bind thyroglobulin (Tg), a major  thyroid-specific protein. Tg plays a crucial role in thyroid hormone  synthesis, storage, and release. Noniodinated Tg is actively  transported from thyrocyte cytosol to the thyroid follicular lumen.  At the extracellular apical villae-follicular luminal interface, thyroid  peroxidase (TPO) catalyzes the iodination of tyrosine and  thyronine residues of Tg. This is followed by intramolecular  coupling of pairs of mono- and diiodotyrosines to form thyroid  hormones, predominately thyroxine (T4) or, to lesser degree,  triiodothyronine (T3). The iodinated Tg is stored in the follicular  lumen, forming the colloid. For thyroid hormone release, colloid  is reabsorbed at the apical membrane and proteolyzed.  Iodinated tyrosine residues are deiodinated and recycled for  synthesis of new Tg molecules, while the bulk of T3 and T4  residues are secreted from the basal membrane into the systemic  circulation.  Tg is not secreted into the systemic circulation under normal  circumstances. However, follicular destruction through inflammation  (thyroiditis and autoimmune hypothyroidism), hemorrhage (nodular  goiter), or rapid disordered growth of thyroid tissue, as may be  observed in Graves disease or follicular cell-derived thyroid  neoplasms, can result in leakage of Tg into the blood stream.  This results in the formation of autoantibodies to Tg in some  individuals. The same processes also may result in exposure  of other \"hidden\" thyroid antigens to the immune system, resulting  in autoantibody formation to other thyroid antigens, in particular  TPO. Since anti-Tg and anti-TPO autoantibodies are observed  most frequently in autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto's disease),  they were originally considered to be of possible pathogenic  significance in this disorder. However, the consensus opinion today  is that they are merely disease markers. It is felt that the presence  of competent immune cells at the site of thyroid tissue destruction  in autoimmune thyroiditis simply predisposes the patient to form  autoantibodies to hidden thyroid antigens.  Of individuals with autoimmune hypothyroidism, 30% to 50% will have  detectable anti-Tg autoantibodies, while 50% to 90% will have detectable  anti-TPO autoantibodies. In Graves disease, both types of autoanti-bodies are observed at approximately half these rates, while  in papillary and follicular thyroid cancer, mainly anti-Tg autoantibodies are   detected at rates of 10% to 20%. In this latter case, the main importance  of anti-Tg measurement is identification of individuals in whom  measurement of circulating Tg cannot be relied upon as a tumor  marker during follow-up. The presence of anti-Tg autoantibodies  may lead to false-low, or less commonly, false-high serum Tg  measurements."

        "Thyroid cancer follow-up: Following therapy of differentiated follicular-cell derived thyroid  cancer, all patients who have no, or only trivial, amounts of  normal residual thyroid tissue and no persistent or recurrent  cancer will have undetectable or very low serum Tg levels.

However, if a patient also has measurable  anti-Tg autoantibody levels, the results of serum Tg measurements  are unreliable. Anti-Tg autoantibodies may result in both falsely-low and, less commonly, falsely-high serum Tg measurements.  Therefore, in anti-Tg-positive patients, serum Tg measurements  should either not be used in thyroid cancer follow-up or be  interpreted with extreme caution.Diagnosis of autoimmune thyroid disease: Measurements of anti-TPO autoantibodies have higher  sensitivity and equal specificity to anti-Tg autoantibody  measurements in the diagnosis of autoimmune thyroid  disease. Anti-Tg autoantibody levels should, therefore, only  be measured if anti-TPO autoantibody measurements  are negative, but clinical suspicion of autoimmune thyroid  disease is high.  Positive thyroid autoantibody levels in patients with high-normal  or slightly elevated serum thyrotropin levels predict the future  development of more profound hypothyroidism.  Patients with postpartum thyroiditis with persistently elevated  thyroid autoantibody levels have an increased likelihood of  permanent hypothyroidism.  In cases of neonatal hypothyroidism, the detection of anti-TPO  or anti-Tg autoantibodies in the infant suggests transplacental  antibody transfer, particularly if the mother has a history of  autoimmune thyroiditis or detectable thyroid autoantibodies.  The neonatal hypothyroidism is likely to be transient in these cases."
