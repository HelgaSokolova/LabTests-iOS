        "Autoimmune thyroid disease is characterized by the presence of   autoantibodies against various thyroid components, namely the   thyrotropin receptor (TSHR), thyroid peroxidase (TPO), and   thyroglobulin (Tg), as well as by an inflammatory cellular infiltrate   of variable severity within the gland.  Among the autoantibodies found in autoimmune thyroid disease,   TSHR autoantibodies are most closely associated with disease   pathogenesis. All forms of autoimmune thyrotoxicosis (Graves  disease, Hashitoxicosis, neonatal thyrotoxicosis) are caused by   the production of TSHR-stimulating autoantibodies. These   stimulating autoantibodies, which are also known as long-acting-thyroid-stimulator (LATS) or thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins   (TSI), bind to the receptor and transactivate it, leading to stimulation   of the thyroid gland independent of the normal feedback-regulated   thyrotropin (TSH) stimulation.  Some patients with Graves disease also have TSHR-blocking   antibodies, which do not transactivate the TSHR. The balance   between TSI and TSHR-blocking antibodies, as well as their   individual titers, are felt to be determinants of Graves disease   severity. At least 20% of patients with autoimmune hypothyroidism   also have evidence of either TSHR-blocking antibodies or, rarely, TSI.  The role of the Tg and TPO autoantibodies in relation to disease   development is less well established; they may represent merely   epiphenomena. They are observed mainly in autoimmune   hypothyroidism, with prevalences of TPO autoantibodies and Tg   autoantibodies of 50% to 90% and 30% to 50%, respectively.  TSHR autoantibodies may be detected before autoimmune   thyrotoxicosis becomes biochemically or clinically manifest. Since   none of the treatments for Graves disease are aimed at the underlying   disease process, but rather ablate thyroid tissue or block thyroid   hormone synthesis, TSI may persist after apparent clinical cure.   This is of particular relevance for pregnant women with a history of   Graves disease that was treated with thyroid-ablative therapy. Some   of these women may continue to produce TSI. Since TSI are IgG   antibodies, they can cross the placental barrier causing neonatal   thyrotoxicosis.  While the gold standard for thyroid stimulating immunoglobulins is   the Thyroid-Stimulating Immunoglobulin (TSI), the thyrotropin receptor antibody test has a shorter   turnaround time, less analytical variability, and is less expensive.   It is the recommended first-line test for detection of thyrotropin   receptor antibodies."

        "The sensitivity and specificity of an elevated TSHR autoantibody   (TRAb) test for Graves disease diagnosis depends on whether   patients have clinically active, untreated disease, or disease   treated with antithyroid drugs. In newly diagnosed untreated patients,  the sensitivity and specificity are both around 90%. In patients with   inactive or treated Graves disease, the specificity is similar, while   sensitivity is lower, ranging from 40% to 80%.  Assessment of TRAb status is particularly relevant in women who   have previously undergone thyroid-ablative therapy or are on active   antithyroid treatment and, therefore, no longer display biochemical   or clinical evidence of thyrotoxicosis. Significant neonatal   thyrotoxicosis is likely if a pregnant woman with a history of Graves   disease has a TRAb test of >40% binding during the last trimester,   regardless of her clinical remission status. Lesser elevations are   only occasionally associated with neonatal thyrotoxicosis.  Gestational thyrotoxicosis, which is believed to be due to a   combination of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) cross-reactivity   on the TSHR and transient changes in thyroid hormone protein   binding, is only very rarely associated with an elevated TRAb test.   Finding an elevated TRAb test in this setting suggests usually   underlying Graves disease.  An elevated TRAb test at the conclusion of a course of antithyroid   drug treatment is highly predictive of relapse of Graves disease.   However, the converse, a normal TRAb test, is not predictive of   prolonged remission.  Approximately 20% of patients with autoimmune hypothyroidism have   no goiter. In this so-called atrophic hypothyroidism, TSHR-blocking   autoantibodies are found in 40% to 80% of the cases. These can be   detected by elevated binding in the TRAb assay.  In patients with thyroid function tests that fluctuate between hypo- and   hyperthyroidism or vice versa, a clearly elevated TRAb level (>25%)   and a simultaneous TSI index that are normal or only minimally   elevated (1.3%-1.8%) suggest a diagnosis of possible Hashitoxicosis."
