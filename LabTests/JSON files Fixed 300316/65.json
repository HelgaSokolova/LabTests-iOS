        "Lead is a heavy metal commonly found in man's environment that  can be an acute and chronic toxin.    Lead is present in paints manufactured before 1970. Lead was  banned from household paints in 1972 but is still found in paint   produced for non-domestic use and in artistic pigments. Ceramic  products available from non-commercial suppliers (such as local  artists) often contain significant amounts of lead that can be leached  from the ceramic by weak acids such as vinegar and fruit juices.  Lead is found in dirt from areas adjacent to homes painted with  lead-based paints and highways where lead accumulates from  use of leaded gasoline. Use of leaded gasoline has diminished  significantly since the introduction of non-lead gasolines that have  been required in personal automobiles since 1972. Lead is found  in soil near abandoned industrial sites where lead may have been  used. Water transported through lead or lead-soldered pipe will  contain some lead with higher concentrations found in water that is  weakly acidic. Some foods (eg, moonshine distilled in lead pipes)  and some traditional home medicines contain lead.      Exposure to lead  either by ingestion,  inhalation, or dermal contact can cause significant toxicity.    Lead expresses its toxicity by several mechanisms. It avidly inhibits  aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALA-D) and ferrochelatase,  two of the enzymes that catalyze synthesis of heme. Inhibition of  ALA-D and ferrochelatase causes accumulation of delta aminolevulinic  acid in urine and protoporphyrin in erythrocytes, which are markers  for significant lead exposure.    Lead also is an electrophile that avidly forms covalent bonds with  the sulfhydryl group of cysteine in proteins. Thus, proteins in all tissues  exposed to lead will have bound to them.    Keratin in hair contains a high fraction of cysteine relative to other amino  acids. The cysteine residues are cross-linked through lead, thereby  causing the tertiary structure of the protein to change; cells of the nervous  system are particularly susceptible to this effect. Some lead-bound  proteins change their tertiary configuration sufficiently that they become  antigenic; renal tubular cells are particularly susceptible to this effect  because they are exposed to relatively high lead concentrations during  clearance.      A typical diet in the United States contributes approximately 300 ug  of lead per day, of which 1-10% is absorbed; children may absorb as  much as 50% of the dietary intake, and the fraction of lead absorbed  is enhanced by nutritional deficiency. The majority of the daily intake  is excreted in the stool after direct passage through the gastrointestinal  tract. While a significant fraction of the absorbed lead is rapidly  incorporated into bone and erythrocytes, lead ultimately distributes  among all tissues, with lipid-dense tissues such as the central nervous  system particularly sensitive to organic forms of lead. All lead absorbed  is ultimately excreted in the bile or urine. Soft-tissue turnover of lead  occurs within approximately 120 days.    Avoidance of exposure to lead is the treatment of choice. However,  chelation therapy is available to treat severe disease. British anti-Lewisite (BAL) administered intravenously was the classical mode of  chelation therapy. Oral dimercaprol has recently become available  and is being used in the outpatient setting except in the most severe  cases.    Measurement of urine excretion rates either before or after chelation  therapy has been used as an indicator of lead exposure. However,   blood lead analysis has the strongest correlation with toxicity."
