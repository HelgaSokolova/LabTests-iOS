        "Hemoglobinuria  is an indicator of intravascular hemolysis. The test is equally sensitive to myoglobin  as to hemoglobin (Hgb). The presence of Hgb, in the absence of RBCs, is  consistent with intravascular hemolysis. RBCs may be missed if lysis occurred  prior to analysis; the absence of RBCs should be confirmed by examining a fresh  specimen.  Elevated Specific gravity, elevated protein and large amounts of ascorbic acid  may cause false negative results. Oxidizing substances such as hypo-chlorite  and chlorine may cause false positive results.The test is equally sensitive to  hemoglobin and to myoglobin.

        "The kidney plays a key role in the excretion of by-products of cellular  metabolism and regulation of water, acid-base, and electrolyte balance. Urine  is produced by filtration of plasma in the renal glomeruli, followed by tubular  secretion and/or reabsorption of water and other compounds.     Abnormalities detected by urinalysis may reflect either urinary tract diseases  (eg, infection, glomerulonephritis, loss of concentrating capacity) or  extrarenal disease processes (eg, glucosuria in diabetes, proteinuria in  monoclonal gammopathies, bilirubinuria in liver disease)."
