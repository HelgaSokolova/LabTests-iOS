With deep or rapid breathing, this can be increased to 98-99%. While breathing oxygen-enriched air (40% - 100%), the oxygen saturation can be pushed to 100%."

        "Oxygen Saturation will fall if: Inspired oxygen levels are diminished, such as at increased altitudes. Upper or middle airway obstruction exists (such as during an acute asthmatic attack).  Significant alveolar lung disease exists, interfering with the free flow of oxygen across the alveolar membrane.   Oxygen Saturation will rise if: Deep or rapid breathing occurs. Inspired oxygen levels are increased, such as breathing from a 100% oxygen source"
