        "Lipases are enzymes that hydrolyze glycerol esters of long-chain   fatty acids and produce fatty acids and 2-acylglycerol. Bile salts   and a cofactor, colipase, are required for full catalytic activity and   greatest specificity.     The pancreas is the primary source of serum lipase. Both lipase   and colipase are synthesized in the pancreatic acinar cells and   secreted by the pancreas in roughly equimolar amounts. Lipase   is filtered and reabsorbed by the kidneys. Pancreatic injury results   in increased serum lipase levels."

        "In pancreatitis, lipase becomes elevated at about the same time as amylase (in 4-8 hours), but  lipase may rise to a greater extent and    remain elevated much longer (7-10 days) than amylase.    Elevations 2-50 times the upper reference have been reported.    The increase in serum lipase is not necessarily proportional to    the severity of the attack. Normalization is not necessarily a sign   of resolution.   In acute pancreatitis, normoamylasemia may occur in up to 20% of    such patients. Likewise, the existence if hyperlipemia may cause a    spurious normoamylasemia. For these reasons, it is suggested that   amylase and lipase complement, and not exclude each other, and    that both enzymes should be assayed."
