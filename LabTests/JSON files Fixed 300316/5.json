Wt. = 60) that is  freely filtered by glomeruli and the majority is excreted into the urine, although variable amounts are reabsorbed along the  nephron.  It is the major end product of protein metabolism in  humans and other mammals.  Approximately 50% of urinary solute  excretion and 90-95% of total nitrogen excretion  is composed of  urea under normal conditions.Factors which tend to increase urea  excretion include increases in glomerular filtration rate, increased  dietary protein intake, protein catabolic conditions, and water  diuretic states.Factors which reduce urea excretion include low  protein intake and conditions which result in low urine output  (e.g. dehydration)."],
