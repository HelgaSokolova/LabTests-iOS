        "Amylases are a group of hydrolases that degrade complex  carbohydrates into fragments. Amylase is produced primarily  by the exocrine pancreas where the enzyme is synthesized by  the acinar cells and then secreted into the intestinal tract by  way of the pancreatic duct system. Amylases also are  produced by the salivary glands, small intestine mucosa,  ovaries, placenta, liver, and fallopian tubes. Pancreatic andsalivary isoenzymes are found in serum."

        "In acute pancreatitis, a transient rise in serum amylase activity occurs   within 2-12 hours of onset; levels return to normal by the third or fourth   day. A 4-6 fold elevation of amylase activity above the reference limit   is usual with the maximal levels obtained in 12-72 hours. However, a   significant number of subjects show lesser elevations and sometimes  none. The magnitude of the elevation of serum enzyme activity is not  related to the severity of pancreatic involvement. Normalization is  not necessarily a sign of resolution.  Because it is produced by several organs, amylase is not a specific   indicator of pancreatic function. Elevated levels also may be seen in   a number of non-pancreatic disease processes including mumps,   salivary duct obstruction, ectopic pregnancy, and intestinal obstruction/  infarction."
