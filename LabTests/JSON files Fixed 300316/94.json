        "Bicarbonate is not usually tested by itself. It may be done on a blood sample taken from a vein as part of a panel of tests that looks at other electrolytes, such as sodium, potassium, and chloride. It is often done along with a carbon dioxide test or as part of an arterial blood gas (ABG) test. For an arterial blood gas study, the blood sample is taken from an artery.  A bicarbonate (HCO3) test helps find and keeps track of conditions that affect blood bicarbonate levels, including many kidney diseases, some lung diseases, and metabolic conditions."
