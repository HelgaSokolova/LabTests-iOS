Therapeutic ranges are based on specimens drawn  at trough (i.e. immediately before the next scheduled   dose). Blood drawn at other times will yield higher results."

        "Cyclosporine is a lipophilic polypeptide  used to prevent rejection after  solid organ transplantation.   There is substantial interpatient variability in absorption, half-life, and other pharmacokinetic parameters.  Cyclosporine is known for many drug interactions, including increased neuro-  and nephrotoxicity   when coadministered with antibiotics, antifungals, or other immunosuppressants. Cyclosporine has a  narrow therapeutic range with  frequent adverse effects making therapeutic drug monitoring essential."
