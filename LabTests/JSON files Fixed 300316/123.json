        "CEA is a glycoprotein normally found in  embryonic entodermal epithelium.     Increased levels may be found in patients with primary colorectal cancer or  other malignancies including medullary thyroid carcinoma and breast, gastrointestinal tract,  liver, lung, ovarian, pancreatic,   and prostatic cancers.     Serial monitoring of CEA should begin prior to therapy to verify post therapy decrease in concentration and  to establish a baseline for evaluating  possible recurrence. Levels generally return to normal   within 1 to 4 months after removal of cancerous tissue.  Single values of CEA are less informative  than changes assessed over time.      Some patients who have been exposed to animal antigens, either in the  environment or as part of treatment or imaging procedures, may have circulating  antianimal antibodies present. These antibodies   may interfere with the assay reagents to produce unreliable results."
