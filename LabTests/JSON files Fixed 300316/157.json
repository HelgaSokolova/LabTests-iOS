        "Paracetamole is a popular analgesic, antipyretic drug lacking significant  anti-inflammatory activity. It is metabolized by the liver with a normal  elimination half-life of <4 hours. In normal therapeutic doses, a minor  metabolite, possessing electrophilic alkylating activity, readily reacts with  glutathione in the liver to yield a detoxified product."

        "In overdose situations,  liver glutathione is consumed and the toxic metabolite (postulated metabolite:  benzoquinone) reacts with cellular proteins resulting in hepatotoxicity,  characterized by centrilobular necrosis, and possible death, if untreated N-acetylcysteine  can substitute for glutathione and serves as an antidote.  Remember that first specimen should be  drawn no sooner than 2 hours post-ingestion."
