        "The term folate refers to all derivatives of folic acid.     Approximately 20% of the folate absorbed daily is derived from  dietary sources; the remainder is synthesized by intestinal  microorganisms. Serum folate levels typically fall within a few  days after dietary folate intake is reduced and may be low in the  presence of  normal tissue stores. Red blood cell folate levels are  less subject to short-term dietary changes.   Significant folate deficiency is characteristically associated with  macrocytosis and megaloblastic anemia. Lower than normal  serum folate also has been reported in patients with neuropsychiatric  disorders, in pregnant women whose fetuses have neural tube  defects, and in women who have recently had spontaneous  abortions.  Folate deficiency is most commonly due to insufficient  dietary intake and is most frequently encountered in pregnant women  or in alcoholics.    Other causes of low serum folate concentration include:   Excessive utilization (e.g., liver disease, hemolytic disorders, and  malignancies),  Rare inborn errors of metabolism (eg, dihydrofolate reductase deficiency, forminotransferase deficiency, 5,10-methylenetetra-hydrofolate reductase deficiency, and tetrahydrofolate methyltransferase deficiency)"

        "Serum folate is a relatively nonspecific test. Low serum folate levels  may be seen in the absence of deficiency and normal levels may  be seen in patients with macrocytic anemia dementia, neuropsychiatric  disorders, and pregnancy disorders.   Evaluation of macrocytic anemias commonly requires measurement  of the serum concentration of both vitamin B12 and folate; ideally  they should be measured at the same point in time.    Additional testing with homocysteine and methylmalonic acid  determinations may help distinguish between vitamin B12 and folate  deficiency states. In folate deficiency, homocysteine levels are  elevated and methylmalonic acid levels are normal. In vitamin B12  deficiency, both homocysteine levels and methylmalonic acid  levels are elevated."
