        "Approximately 85% of the total bilirubin produced is derived from  the heme moiety of hemoglobin, while the remaining 15% is produced  from the red blood cell precursors destroyed in the bone marrow  and from the catabolism of other heme-containing proteins. After  production in peripheral tissues, bilirubin is rapidly taken up by   hepatocytes where it is conjugated with glucuronic acid to produce  mono- and diglucuronide, which are excreted in the bile. Direct  bilirubin is a measurement of conjugated bilirubin.  Jaundice can occur as a result of problems at each step in the  metabolic pathway. Disorders may be classified as those due to:  increased bilirubin production (e.g., hemolysis and ineffective  erythropoiesis), decreased bilirubin excretion (e.g., obstruction and  hepatitis), and abnormal bilirubin metabolism (e.g., hereditary and  neonatal jaundice).  Inherited disorders in which direct bilirubinemia occurs include  Dubin-Johnson syndrome and Rotor syndrome. Jaundice of the  newborn where direct bilirubin is elevated includes idiopathic  neonatal hepatitis and biliary atresia. The most commonly occurring  form of jaundice of the newborn, physiological jaundice, results in  unconjugated (indirect) hyperbilirubinemia. Elevated unconjugated  bilirubin in the neonatal period may result in brain damage  (kernicterus). Treatment options are phototherapy and, if severe,  exchange transfusion.  The increased production of bilirubin that accompanies the premature  breakdown of erythrocytes and ineffective erythropoiesis results in  hyperbilirubinemia in the absence of any liver abnormality. In  hepatobiliary diseases of various causes, bilirubin uptake, storage,  and excretion are impaired to varying degrees. Thus, both conjugated  and unconjugated bilirubin are retained and a wide range of abnormal  serum concentrations of each form of bilirubin may be observed. Both  conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin are increased in hepatocellular  diseases such as hepatitis and space-occupying lesions of the liver, and  obstructive lesions such as carcinoma of the head of the pancreas,  common bile duct, or ampulla of Vater."
