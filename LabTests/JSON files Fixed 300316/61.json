        "25-Hydroxyvitamin D2 and D3 (25-OH-VitD) are equipotent steroid  hormones that require 1-alpha-hydroxylation before expressing  biological activity. Vitamin D compounds are derived from dietary  ergocalciferol (from plants, VitD2) or cholecalciferol (from animals,  VitD3), or by conversion of 7-dihydrocholesterol to VitD3 in the skin  upon ultraviolet exposure. VitD2 and VitD3 are subsequently  25-hydroxylated in the liver to 25-OH-VitD.25-OH-VitD represents  the main body reservoir and transport form of vitamin D, being  stored in adipose tissue and tightly bound by a transport protein  while in circulation. A fraction of circulating 25-OH-VitD is  converted to its active metabolites 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D2 and  D3 (1,25-OH-VitD), mainly by the kidneys.  This process is  regulated by parathyroid hormone (PTH), which increases  1,25-OH-VitD synthesis at the expense of the alternative,  biologically inactive hydroxylation product 24,25-OH-VitD. Like  other steroid hormones, 1,25-OH-VitD binds to a nuclear receptor,  influencing gene transcription patterns in target organs.    1,25-OH-VitD plays a primary role in the maintenance of calcium  homeostasis. It promotes intestinal calcium absorption and, in  concert with PTH, skeletal calcium deposition, or less commonly,  calcium mobilization. Renal calcium and phosphate reabsorption  are also promoted, while prepro-PTH mRNA expression in the  parathyroid glands is down-regulated. The net result is a positive  calcium balance, increasing serum calcium and phosphate  levels, and falling PTH concentrations.In addition to its effects on calcium and bone metabolism,  1,25-OH-VitD regulates the expression of a multitude of genes  in many other tissues including immune cells, muscle, vasculature,  and reproductive organs.The exact 25-OH-VitD level reflecting optimal body stores remains  unknown."

        "Mild-to-modest deficiency can be associated with osteoporosis or secondary hyperparathyroidism. Severe deficiency  may lead to failure to mineralize newly formed osteoid in bone,  resulting in rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults. The  consequences of vitamin D deficiency on organs other than bone  are not fully known, but may include increased susceptibility to  infections, muscular discomfort, and an increased risk of colon,  breast, and prostate cancer.    Modest 25-OH-VitD deficiency is common; in institutionalized  elderly, its prevalence may be >50%. Although much less  common, severe deficiency is not rare either.    Reasons for suboptimal 25-OH-VitD levels include lack of  sunshine exposure, a particular problem in Northern latitudes  during winter; inadequate intake; malabsorption (e.g., due to  Celiac disease); depressed hepatic vitamin D 25-hydroxylase  activity, secondary to advanced liver disease; and enzymeinducing drugs, in particular many antiepileptic drugs,  including phenytoin, phenobarbital, and carbamazepine, that  increase 25-OH-VitD metabolism.    In contrast to the high prevalence of 25-OH-VitD deficiency,  hypervitaminosis D is rare, and is only seen after prolonged  exposure to extremely high doses of vitamin D. When it occurs,  it can result in severe hypercalcemia and hyperphosphatemia."
