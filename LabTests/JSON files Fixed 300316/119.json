        "Estrogens are increased in liver cirrhosis and in estrogen producing tumors. Elevated estradiol levels may occur due to aromatization of androgens in males, resulting in gynecomastia. Very high estradiol levels are found during the induction of ovulation for assisted reproduction therapy or in pregnancy.    Estrogens are depressed in hypogonadism regardless of etiology (e.g., in Turner's syndrome) and after menopause."
