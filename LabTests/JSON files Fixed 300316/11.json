On demand, iron is released into the blood as Fe(3)-transferrin in   equilibrium with a very small amount of free Fe(3).   Transferrin is the plasma iron transport protein, which binds iron   strongly at physiological pH. Transferrin is generally only 25% to 30%   saturated with iron. The additional amount of iron that can be bound   is the unsaturated iron-binding capacity (UIBC). The sum of the serum   iron and UIBC represents the total iron-binding capacity (TIBC). TIBC   is an indirect measurement of transferrin concentration. Each   transferrin molecule has 2 iron-binding sites. On average, in   normal persons, about 1/3 of the total iron-binding sites are occupied   by iron.     Percent saturation (100 x serum iron/TIBC) is usually normal or   increased in persons who are iron deficient, pregnant, or are   taking oral contraceptive medications. Persons with chronic   inflammatory processes, hemochromatosis, or malignancies   generally display low TIBC."],
