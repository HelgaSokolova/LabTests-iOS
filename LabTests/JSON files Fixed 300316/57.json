        "Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) is a 70-amino acid polypeptide  (molecular weight 7.6 kDa). IGF-1 is a member of a family of closely   related growth factors with high homology to insulin that signal through   a corresponding group of highly homologous tyrosine kinase receptors.  IGF-1 is produced by many tissues, but the liver is the main source  of circulating IGF-1. IGF-1 is the major mediator of the anabolic and  growth-promoting effects of growth hormone (GH). IGF-1 is transported  by IGF-binding proteins, in particular IGFBP-3, which also control its  bioavailability and half-life. Noncomplexed IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 have  short half-lives  of 10 and 30 to 90 minutes, respectively, while  the IGFBP-3/IGF-1 complex is cleared with a much slower half-life of 12  hours. The secretion patterns of IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 mimic each other,  their respective syntheses being controlled by GH. Unlike GH secretion,  which is pulsatile and demonstrates significant diurnal variation, IGF-1  and IGFBP-3 levels show only minor fluctuations. IGF-1 and IGFBP-3  serum levels therefore represent a stable and integrated measurement  of GH production and tissue effect.  Low IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 levels are observed in GH deficiency or GH  resistance. If acquired in childhood, these conditions result in short  stature. Childhood GH deficiency can be an isolated abnormality or  associated with deficiencies of other pituitary hormones. Some of the  latter cases may be due to pituitary or hypothalamic tumors, or result  from cranial radiation or intrathecal chemotherapy for childhood  malignancies. Most GH resistance in childhood is mild-to-moderate,  with causes ranging from poor nutrition to severe systemic illness (eg,  renal failure). These individuals may have IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 levels  within the reference range. Severe childhood GH resistance is rare  and usually due to GH-receptor defects. Both GH deficiency and mild-to-moderate GH resistance can be treated with recombinant human GH  (rhGH) injections. The prevalence and causes of adult GH resistance  are uncertain, but adult GH deficiency is seen mainly in pituitary tumor  patients. It is associated with decreased muscle bulk and increased  cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, but replacement therapy  remains controversial.  Elevated serum IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 levels indicate a sustained over-production of GH, or excessive rhGH therapy. Endogenous GH excess  is caused mostly by GH-secreting pituitary adenomas, resulting in  gigantism, if acquired before epiphyseal closure, and in acromegaly  thereafter. Both conditions are associated with generalized organomegaly,  hypertension, diabetes, cardiomyopathy, osteoarthritis, compression  neuropathies, a mild increase in cancer risk (breast, colon, prostate, lung),  and diminished longevity. It is plausible, but unproven, that long-term  rhGH overtreatment may result in similar adverse outcomes.  Malnutrition results in low IGF-1 levels, which recover with restoration of  adequate nutrition."

        "Both IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 measurements can be used to assess GH  excess or deficiency. However, for all applications, IGF-1 measurement  has generally been shown to have superior diagnostic sensitivity and  specificity, and should be used as the primary test. In particular, in the  diagnosis and follow-up of acromegaly and gigantism, IGFBP-3  measurement adds little if anything to IGF-1 testing. The combination  of IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 measurements appears superior to determining  either analyte alone in the diagnosis of GH deficiency and resistance,  and in the monitoring of rhGH therapy.  IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 levels below the 2.5th percentile for age are  consistent with GH deficiency or severe GH resistance, but patients  with incomplete GH deficiency or mild-to-moderate GH resistance  may have levels within the reference range. In GH deficiency, GH  levels may also be low and can show suboptimal responses in  stimulation tests (eg, exercise, clonidine, arginine, ghrelin, growth  hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH), insulin-induced hypoglycemia),  while in severe GH resistance, GH levels are substantially elevated.  However, dynamic GH testing is not always necessary for diagnosis.  If it is undertaken, it should be performed and interpreted in endocrine  testing centers under the supervision of a pediatric or adult endocrinologist.  The aim of both pediatric and adult GH replacement therapy is to achieve  IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 levels within the reference range, ideally within the  middle-to-upper third. Higher levels are rarely associated with any further  therapeutic gains, but could potentially lead to long-term problems of  GH excess.  Elevated IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 levels support the diagnosis of acromegaly  or gigantism in individuals with appropriate symptoms or signs. In successfully treated patients, both levels should be within the normal  range, ideally within the lower third. In both diagnosis and follow-up,  IGF-1 levels correlate better with clinical disease activity than IGFBP-3  levels.  After transsphenoidal removal of pituitary tumors in patients with  acromegaly, IGF-I concentration starts to decrease and returns to  normal levels in most patients postoperatively by the fourth day.  Persons with anorexia or malnutrition have low values of IGF-1. IGF-1  is a more sensitive indicator than prealbumin, retinol-binding protein,  or transferrin for monitoring nutritional repletion."
