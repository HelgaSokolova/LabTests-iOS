        "After delivery, miscarriage, or pregnancy  termination, hCG falls with a half-life of 24 to 36 hours, until prepregnancy  levels are reached. An absent or  significantly slower decline is seen in patients with  retained products of conception.     GTD is associated with very considerable elevations of hCG, usually above 2  multiples of the medians for gestational age persisting or even rising beyond  the first trimester.     Serum hCG levels are elevated in approximately 40% to 50% of patients with  nonseminomatous testicular cancer and 20% to 40% of patients with seminoma.  Markedly elevated levels of hCG (>5,000 IU/L) are uncommon in patients with  pure seminoma and indicate the presence of a mixed testicular cancer.     Ovarian germ cell tumors (approximately 10% of ovarian tumors) display elevated  hCG levels in a similar percentage of cases. Teratomas in children may  overproduce hCG, even when benign, in children resulting in precocious pseudopuberty.  Levels may be elevated to similar levels as seen in testicular cancer.     Among nonreproductive tumors, hepatobillary tumors (hepatoblastomas, hepatocellular  carcinomas, and cholangiocarcinomas) and neuroendocrine  tumors (e.g. islet cell tumors and carcinoids) are those most commonly associated with  hCG production.     Many hCG-producing tumors also produce other embryonic proteins/antigens, in particular alpha  fetoprotein (AFP). AFP should, therefore,  also be measured in the diagnostic work-up of such neoplasms.     Complete therapeutic response in hCG-secreting tumors is characterized by a decline in hCG  levels with an apparent half-life of  24 to 36 hours and eventual return to concentrations within the reference   range. GTD and some tumors may produce hyperglycoslated hCG with a longer half-life, but an  apparent half-life of >3 days suggests the presence  of residual hCG-producing tumor tissue.     A rise in hCG levels above the reference range in patients with hCG-producing  tumors that had previously been treated successfully, suggests possible local  or distant metastatic recurrence."

        "After delivery, miscarriage, or pregnancy-termination,  hCG falls with a half-life of 24 to 36 hours, until prepregnancy levels are  reached.     Outside of pregnancy, hCG may be secreted by abnormal germ cell, placental or  embryonal tissues, in particular: seminomatous and non-seminomatous testicular  tumors, ovarian germ cell tumors,  gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD; hydatidiform mole and choriocarcinoma)  and benign or malignant nontesticular teratomas. Rarely, other tumors including  hepatic, neuroendocrine, breast, ovarian, pancreatic, cervical and gastric  cancers may secrete hCG, usually in relatively  modest quantities.      With successful treatment of hCG-producing tumors, hCG levels should fall with  a half-life of 24 to 36 hours, and eventually return to the reference range.  Transient elevations of serum hCG can  occur following chemotherapy in patients with susceptible tumors, due to  massive tumor cell lysis; these transient elevations should not be confused  with tumor progression.     Normal serum levels of hCG do not always exclude tumor persistence since  tumors may undergo transition to differentiated teratomas, which may not produce hCG.      End-stage renal failure is associated with up to 10-fold elevations in serum  hCG levels."
