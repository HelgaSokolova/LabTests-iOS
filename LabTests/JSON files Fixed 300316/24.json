        "GGT measurement is principally used to diagnose and monitor   hepatobiliary disease. It is currently the most sensitive enzymatic   indicator of liver disease.   GGT in serum can be used to ascertain whether observed   elevations of ALP is due to skeletal disease (normal GGT) or   reflects the presence of hepatobiliary disease (elevated GGT).   GGT is also used as a screening test for occult alcoholism."

        "Gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) is primarily present in kidney,   liver and pancreatic cells. Small amounts are present in other tissues.    Even though renal tissue has the highest level of GGT, the enzyme   present in the serum appears to originate primarily from the hepatobiliary   system, and GGT activity is elevated in any and all forms of liver   disease. It is highest in cases of intra- or post-hepatic biliary obstruction,   reaching levels some 5-30 times normal. It is more sensitive   than alkaline phosphatase (ALP), leucine aminopeptidase,   aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT)  in detecting obstructive jaundice, cholangitis and cholecystitis; its rise   occurs earlier than with these other enzymes and persists longer.Only modest elevations (2-5 times normal) occur in infectious hepatitis,   and in this condition GGT determinations are less useful diagnostically   than are measurements of the transaminases.   High elevations of GGT   are also observed in patients with either primary or secondary (metastatic)   neoplasms. Elevated levels of GGT are noted not only in the sera of   patients with alcoholic cirrhosis but also in the majority of sera from   persons who are heavy drinkers. Studies have emphasized the value   of serum GGT levels in detecting alcohol-induced liver disease.      Elevated serum values are also seen in patients receiving drugs such   as phenytoin and phenobarbital, and this is thought to reflect induction   of new enzyme activity.  Normal values are observed in various muscle diseases and in renal   failure. Normal values are also seen in cases of skeletal disease,   children older that 1 year and in healthy pregnant women-conditions in   which ALP is elevated."
