A history of pregnancy morbidity defined as one or more unexplained  deaths of a morphologically normal fetus beyond the 10th week of  gestation, one or more premature births before 34 weeks of gestation  caused by severe preeclampsia or placental insufficiency, or three or  more unexplained, consecutive spontaneous abortions before the  10th week of gestation with no identifiable maternal hormonal or  anatomic, or maternal or paternal chromosomal causes.  Presence of an unexplained cutaneous circulatory disturbance (eg,  livido reticularis or pyoderma gangrenosum).  Presence of a systemic rheumatic disease especially lupus  erythematosus.  Unexplained thrombocytopenia or hemolytic anemia."

        "The plasma membranes of mammalian cells are formed from phosphorlipids.  Plasma from normal individuals contains low  concentrations of natural IgG autoantibodies of moderate affinity.  Pathologic levels of autoantibodies reflect loss of tolerance and  increased production of antibodies. These autoantibodies are called  phospholipid or cardiolipin antibodies when they are detected by  immunoassays that employ anionic phospholipids as substrates.  The most commonly used phospholipid substrate is cardiolipin.  It is  hypothesized that complexes formed in vivo bind to translocated, anionic phospholipid  on activated platelets at sites of endothelial injury. This binding is  believed to promote further platelet activation that may lead to thrombosis.    Phospholipid antibodies occur in patients with a variety of clinical  signs and symptoms notably thrombosis (arterial or venous)  pregnancy morbidity (unexplained fetal death, premature birth,  severe preeclampsia, or placental insufficiency) unexplained  cutaneous circulation disturbances (livido reticularis or pyoderma  gangrenosum) thrombocytopenia or hemolytic anemia and nonbacterial  thrombotic endocarditis.  Phospholipid antibodies and lupus  anticoagulants are found with increased frequency in patients with  systemic rheumatic diseases especially lupus erythematosus. The  term antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) or Hughes' syndrome is used  to describe the triad of thrombosis, recurrent fetal loss and thrombocytopenia accompanied by phospholipid antibodies or a lupus  anticoagulant. The diagnosis of APS requires one or more of the above  mentioned clinical findings plus positive test results for phospholipid  antibodies (≥40 GPL or MPL) or positive tests for a lupus"
