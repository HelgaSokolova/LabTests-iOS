        "Zinc is an essential element; it is a critical co-factor for carbonic   anhydrase, alkaline phosphatase, RNA and DNA polymerases,    alcohol dehydrogenase, and many other physiologically important    proteins. The peptidases, kinases, and phosphorylases are most    sensitive to zinc depletion.   Zinc is a key element required for active wound healing.   Zinc depletion occurs either because it is not absorbed from the diet   or it is lost after absorption. Dietary deficiency may be due to    absence (parenteral nutrition) or because the zinc in the diet is bound    to phytate (fiber) and not available for absorption. Once absorbed,    the most common route of loss is via exudates from open wounds    such as third degree burn or gastrointestinal loss as in colitis.   Hepatic cirrhosis causes excess loss of zinc by enhancing renal   excretion. Zinc depletion occurs in burn patients who loose zinc in the    exudates from their burn sites.   Zinc excess is not of major clinical concern. The popular American    habit of taking mega-vitamins (containing huge doses of zinc)    produces no direct toxicity problems. Much of this zinc passes through    the gastrointestinal tract and is excreted in the feces. The excess fraction    that is absorbed is excreted in the urine. The only known effect of    excessive zinc ingestion relates to the fact that zinc interferes with copper    absorption that can lead to hypocupremia."

        "Burn patients with acrodermatiitis may have zinc as low as 40 µg/mL;   these patients respond quickly to zinc supplementation.   Other diseases that cause low serum zinc are hepatic cirrhosis,   ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, regional enteritis, sprue,   intestinal bypass, neoplastic disease, and increased catabolism    induced by anabolic steroids. The conditions of anorexia and    starvation also result in low zinc levels.   Elevated serum zinc is of minimal clinical interest."
