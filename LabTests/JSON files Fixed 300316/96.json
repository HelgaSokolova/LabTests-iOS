        "Eosinophil granulocytes  develop during Haematopoiesis in the bone marrow before migrating into blood. In normal individuals eosinophils make up about 1-6% of white blood cells, and are about 12-17 micrometers in size.  Eosinophils persist in the circulation for 8-12 hours, and can survive in tissue for an additional 8-12 days in the absence of stimulation."
