        "CKMB should be ordered only in the following circumstances: if the initial troponin T determination is abnormal or if the patient has   had a suspected re-infarction in the hospital.  The primary source of CKMB is myocardium although it is also found  in skeletal muscle. CKMB levels increase with myocardial damage.  CKMB levels can be detected within 3-8 hours of the onset of chest  pain, peak within 12-24 hours, and usually return to baseline levels  within 24-48 hours. Serial sampling is often performed at admission  and 8, 16, and 24 hours after admission.  Extreme elevations of CKMB can be associated with skeletal muscle  cell turnover as in polymyositis and to a lesser degree in rhabdomyolysis.  It can also be elevated in cases of carbon monoxide poisoning,  crush injuries, pulmonary embolism, hypothyroidism, and muscular  dystrophy."
