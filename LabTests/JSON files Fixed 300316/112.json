        "Methylmalonic acid (MMA) is a specific diagnostic marker for a  group of inherited disorders collectively known as methylmalonic  acidemias, which includes at least 8 different entities identified  according to biochemical phenotype and somatic cell  complementation analysis. Their collective incidence is approximately  1:48,000 live births.    Acquired causes of methylmalonic acidemia are much more common.  Elevated MMA levels in plasma and urine are found in patients with  cobalamin (vitamin B12) deficiency as a consequence of intestinal  malabsorption, impaired digestion, or poor diet. Other conditions  such as renal insufficiency, hypovolemia, and bacterial overgrowth  of the small intestine also contribute to the possible causes of mild  methylmalonic acidemia/-uria.    Elderly patients with cobalamin deficiency may present with  peripheral neuropathy, ataxia, loss of position and vibration senses, memory impairment, depression, and dementia in the absence of anemia."
