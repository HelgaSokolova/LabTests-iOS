        "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) participates in the renin  cascade in response to hypovolemia. Its peptidase action on the  decapeptide angiotensinogen I results in the hydrolysis of a terminal  histadyl lucine dipeptide and the formation of the octapeptide  angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor that increases  blood pressure.    The primary source of ACE is the endothelium of the lung.  ACE  activity is increased in sarcoidosis, a systemic granulomatous  disease that commonly affects the lungs. In sarcoidosis, ACE is  thought to be produced by epithelioid cells and macrophages of  the granuloma.    Currently, it appears that ACE activity reflects the severity of sarcoidosis:   68% positivity in those with stage I sarcoidosis, 86% in stage II  sarcoidosis, and 91% in stage III sarcoidosis. Serum ACE also  appears to reflect the activity of the disease; there is a dramatic  decrease in enzyme activity in some patients receiving prednisone.    Other conditions such as Gaucher's disease, leprosy, untreated  hyperthyroidism, psoriasis, premature infants with   respiratory distress syndrome, adults with amyloidosis, and histoplasmosis have been associated with increased levels of ACE."

        "An elevation in the level of serum ACE, along with radiographic  evidence of infiltrates and/or adenopathy and organ biopsies  showing non-caseating epithelial granulomas, is suggestive of a  diagnosis of sarcoidosis.     Serum ACE is significantly higher in most (approximately 80%)  patients with active sarcoidosis.    ACE is also elevated in a number of other diseases and in  approximately 5% of the normal adult population."
