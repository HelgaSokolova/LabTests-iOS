The International Normalized Ratio (INR) is a   method of standardizing PT reporting for monitoring the intensity of   oral anticoagulant therapy.  The INR is the ratio of the patient's PT to   the mean normal (reference) PT that would have been obtained if   the WHO reference thromboplastin had been used."
