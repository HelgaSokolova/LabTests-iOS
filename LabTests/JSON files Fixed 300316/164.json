        "Normally 1% to 3% of dietary tryptophan is  metabolized to serotonin. However, as much as 60% of tryptophan is converted to  serotonin in patients with the intestinal carcinoid syndrome.     5-Hydroxyindoleacetic acid is the major metabolite of serotonin and is excreted  in the urine.  Intake of food with a high content of  serotonin (avocados, bananas, plums, walnuts, pineapple, eggplant, plantain,  tomatoes, hickory nuts, kiwi, dates, grapefruit, butternuts, melons, nuts,  pecans, cantaloupe, or honeydew melon) within 48 hours of the urine collection  could result in falsely elevated 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) excretion.     Numerous drugs affect the excretion of 5-HIAA by different mechanisms,  including increased serotonin synthesis, metabolism, and release and inhibition  of uptake."
