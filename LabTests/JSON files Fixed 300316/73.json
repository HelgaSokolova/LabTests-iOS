The release of proteolytic enzymes from plasma onto organ   surfaces and into tissue spaces results in tissue damage   unless inhibitors are present.    Congenital deficiency of A1A is associated with the development   of emphysema at an unusually early age and with an increased   incidence of neonatal hepatitis, usually progressing to cirrhosis."
