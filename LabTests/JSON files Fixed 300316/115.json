        "The renal juxtaglomerular apparatus generates renin, an enzyme  that converts angiotensinogen to angiotensin I. The inactive  angiotensin I is enzymatically converted to the active octapeptide  angiotensin II, a potent vasopressor responsible for hypertension of renal  origin. Angiotensin II also stimulates the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal  cortex to release aldosterone.     Renin secretion by the kidney is stimulated by a fall in glomerular blood  pressure, by decreased sodium concentration at the macula densa at the  distal tubule, or by stimulation of sympathetic outflow to the kidney, such  as in renal vascular diseases."
