In diabetics who  are unable to efficiently utilize glucose due to a lack of insulin, starvation,  or with other abnormalities of carbohydrate or lipid metabolism, ketones may  appear in the urine in large amounts before serum ketone is elevated.  Substances causing false positive are bromsulphalein (BSP),  phenolsulfonphthalein (PSP), phenylketone, cephalosporin, aldose reductive  antienzyme, and L-Dopa Fasting or starvation diets may cause positive results."
