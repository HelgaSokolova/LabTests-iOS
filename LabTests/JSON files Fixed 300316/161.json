        "Volatiles: Volatile substances in the blood include acetone, methanol, isopropanol, and  ethanol. Acetone is generally elevated in metabolic conditions such diabetic  ketoacidosis. Methanol and isopropanol  are highly toxic and result from exogenous ingestion.     Ethanol is the single most important substance of abuse. It is the active agent  in beer, wine, vodka, whiskey, rum, and other liquors. Ethanol acts on cerebral  function as a depressant similar  to general anesthetics. This depression causes  most of the typical symptoms of  intoxication including impaired  thought,  clouded judgment, and changed behavior. As the level of  alcohol increases, the degree of  impairment becomes progressively increased.     \n\nEthylene Glycol: Ethylene glycol is the active ingredient in automobile antifreeze which is  sometimes consumed as a substitute for ethanol since in the early stages the inebriating  effects of the 2 chemicals are similar. It is converted to several toxic,  acidic metabolites including oxalic  acid, which precipitates as calcium oxalate crystals in the kidney, identifiable as such in the urine."
