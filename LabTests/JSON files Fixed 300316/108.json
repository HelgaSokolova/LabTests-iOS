        "Lupus-like anticoagulant (LA) is antibody to negatively charged  phospholipid and interferes with coagulation tests that are phospholipid  dependent. LA has been associated with arterial and venous  thrombosis and fetal loss. Individuals with thrombocytopenia or  factor II deficiency associated with LA may be at risk for bleeding.    LA is found in, but not limited to, patients with systemic lupus  erythematosus. LA is found in other autoimmune disorders and collagen  vascular diseases. It occurs in response to medications or certain  infections (eg, respiratory tract infections in children) and in individuals  with no obvious underlying disease."
