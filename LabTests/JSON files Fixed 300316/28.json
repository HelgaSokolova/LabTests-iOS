        "Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) is found in high concentrations  in liver, heart, skeletal muscle, and kidney. AST is present in both  the cytoplasm and mitochondria of cells. In cases involving mild  tissue injury, the predominant form of AST is that from the  cytoplasm. Severe tissue damage results in more of the  mitochondrial enzyme being released. High levels of AST can  be found in cases such as myocardial infarction, acute liver cell  damage, viral hepatitis, and carbon tetrachloride poisoning.   Slight-to-moderate elevation of AST is seen in muscular dystrophy,  dermatomyositis, acute pancreatitis, and crushed muscle injuries."

        "Elevated AST values are seen in parenchymal liver diseases  characterized by a destruction of hepatocytes. Values are typically  at least 10 times above the normal range. Levels may reach  values as high as 100 times the upper reference limit, although  20 to 50-fold elevations are most frequently encountered. In  infectious hepatitis and other inflammatory conditions affecting the  liver, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) is characteristically as high  as or higher than AST, and the ALT/AST ratio, which normally and  in other conditions is less than 1, becomes greater than unity. AST  levels are usually elevated before clinical signs and symptoms of  disease appear. Five to 10-fold elevations of both AST and ALT  occur in patients with primary or metastatic carcinoma of the liver,  with AST usually being higher than ALT, but levels are often  normal in the early stages of malignant infiltration of the liver.  Elevations of ALT activity persist longer than do those of AST  activity.  Elevated AST values may also be seen in disorders affectingthe heart, skeletal muscle, and kidney."
