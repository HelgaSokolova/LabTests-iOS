Analysis for 17-hydroxyprogesterone is also useful as part of a  battery of tests to evaluate females with hirsutism or infertility.   Both can result from adult-onset CAH."

        "Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is caused by inherited defects  in steroid biosynthesis. The resulting hormone imbalances with  reduced glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids and elevated  17-hydroxyprogesterone (OHPG) and androgens can lead to life-  threatening, salt-wasting crisis in the newborn period and incorrect  gender assignment of virtualized females. Adult-onset CAH may  result in hirsutism or infertility in females.    The adrenal glands, ovaries, testes, and placenta produce  OHPG. It is hydroxylated at the 11 and 21 position to produce cortisol.  Deficiency of either 11- or 21- hydroxylase results in decreased cortisol  synthesis, and feedback inhibition of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)  secretion is lost. Consequent increased pituitary release of ACTH  increases production of OHPG. But, if 17-alpha-hydroxylase (which  allows formation of OHPG from progesterone) or 3-beta-ol-dehydrogenase  (which allows formation of 17-hydroxyprogesterone formation from  17-hydroxypregnenolone) are deficient, OHPG levels are low with  possible increase in progesterone or pregnenolone respectively.     OHPG is converted to pregnanetriol, which  is conjugated and excreted in the urine. In all instances, more specific  tests are available to diagnose disorders or steroid metabolism than  pregnanetriol measurement.    Most (90%) cases of CAH are due to mutations in the steroid  21-hydroxylase gene (Cyp21). CAH due to 21-hydroxylase  deficiency is diagnosed by confirming elevations of OHPG  and androstenedione   with decreased cortisol.   By contrast, in two less common forms of CAH, due to   17-hydroxylase or 11-hydroxylase deficiency, OHPG and   androstenedione levels are not significantly elevated and  measurement of progesterone   and deoxycorticosterone, respectively, are necessary for diagnosis."

        "Diagnosis and differential diagnosis of CAH always requires the  measurement of several steroids. Patients with CAH due to steroid  21-hydroxylase gene (Cyp21) mutations usually have very high  levels of androstenedione, often 5-fold to 10-fold elevations. OHPG  levels are usually even higher, while cortisol levels are low or   undetectable. All three analytes should be tested.    In the much less common Cyp11A  mutation, andostenedione  levels are elevated to a similar extent as in Cyp21 mutation, and  cortisol is also low, but OHPG is only mildly, if at all, elevated.    In the also very rare 17-alpha-hydroxylase deficiency, androstenedione,  all other androgen-precursors (17-alpha-hydroxypregnenolone,  OHPG, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate [DHEA-S]), androgens  (testosterone, estrone, estradiol), and cortisol are low, while  production of mineral corticoid and its precursors, in particular  progesterone, 11-deoxycorticosterone, and 18-hydroxycorticosterone,  are increased.    The goal of CAH treatment is normalization of cortisol levels and  ideally also of sex-steroid levels. Traditionally, OHPG and urinary  pregnanetriol or total ketosteroid excretion are measured to guide  treatment, but these tests correlate only modestly with androgen  levels. Therefore, androstenedione and testosterone should also  be measured and used to guide treatment modifications. Normal  prepubertal levels may be difficult to achieve, but if testosterone  levels are within the reference range, androstenedione levels of  up to 100 ng/dL are usually regarded as acceptable."
