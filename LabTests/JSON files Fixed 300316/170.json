        "Osmolality is an index of the solute  concentration of osmotically active particles, principally sodium, chloride,  potassium, and urea. Glucose can contribute significantly to the osmolality  when present in substantial amounts. The ability of the kidney to maintain both  tonicity and water balance of the extracellular fluid can be evaluated by  measuring the osmolality of the urine. More information concerning the state of  renal water handling or abnormalities of urine dilution or concentration can be  obtained if urinary osmolality is compared to serum osmolality. Normally the  ratio of urine osmolality to serum osmolality is 1.0:3.0, reflecting a wide  range of urine osmolality."

        "The kidney plays a key role in the excretion of by-products of cellular  metabolism and regulation of water, acid-base, and electrolyte balance. Urine  is produced by filtration of plasma in the renal glomeruli, followed by tubular  secretion and/or reabsorption of water and other compounds.     Abnormalities detected by urinalysis may reflect either urinary tract diseases  (infection, glomerulonephritis, loss of concentrating capacity) or  extrarenal disease processes (glucosuria in diabetes, proteinuria in  monoclonal gammopathies, bilirubinuria in liver disease)."
