        "Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is secreted by the choroid plexuses, around the  cerebral vessels, and along the walls of the ventricles of the brain, filling  the ventricles and cisternae and bathing the  spinal cord. CSF is reabsorbed into the blood through the arachnoid villi. CSF  turnover is rapid, exchanging about 4 times per day.       CSF glucose levels may be decreased due to consumption by microorganisms, impaired glucose  transport, or increased glycolysis.  Elevated CSF glucose levels are consistent with hyperglycemia."
