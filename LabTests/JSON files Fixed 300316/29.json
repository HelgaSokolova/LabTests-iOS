        "Marked elevations in LD activity can be observed in megaloblastic  anemia, untreated pernicious anemia, Hodgkin's disease,   abdominal and lung cancers, severe shock, and hypoxia.  Moderate to slight increases in LD levels are seen in myocardial  infarction (MI), pulmonary infarction, pulmonary embolism, leukemia,  hemolytic anemia, infectious mononucleosis, progressive muscular  dystrophy (especially in the early and middle stages of the disease),  liver disease, and renal disease.  In liver disease, elevations of LD are not as great as the increases  in aspartate amino transferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase  (ALT).  Increased levels of the enzyme are found in about one third of all  patients with renal disease, especially those with tubular necrosis  or pyelonephritis. However, these elevations do not correlate  well with proteinuria or other parameters of renal disease.  On occasion a raised LD level may be the only evidence to suggest  the presence of a hidden pulmonary embolus."
