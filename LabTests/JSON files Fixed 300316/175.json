        "Bacteria that are capable of converting  nitrates to nitrites (eg, many enteric gram-negative organisms) are detected by  this method; not all urinary pathogens are detected. The proportion of positive  nitrite tests in cases of significant infection depends on how long the urine  specimens were retained in the bladder prior to collection. Identification of  known positive cases with the nitrate test ranges from as low as 40%, when  little bladder incubation occurred, to as high as approximately 80%, when a  minimum of 4 hours of bladder incubation occurred.   Negative results may occur when 1) urinary tract infections are caused  by organisms that do not contain reductase to convert nitrate to nitrite, 2)  when urine has not been retained in the bladder long enough (4 hours or more)  for reduction of nitrate to nitrite to occur, or 3) when dietary nitrate is  absent, even if organisms containing reductase are present and bladder  incubation is ample."

        "The kidney plays a key role in the excretion of by-products of cellular  metabolism and regulation of water, acid-base, and electrolyte balance. Urine  is produced by filtration of plasma in the renal glomeruli, followed by tubular  secretion and/or reabsorption of water and other compounds.     Abnormalities detected by urinalysis may reflect either urinary tract diseases  (eg, infection, glomerulonephritis, loss of concentrating capacity) or  extrarenal disease processes (eg, glucosuria in diabetes, proteinuria in  monoclonal gammopathies, bilirubinuria in liver disease)."
