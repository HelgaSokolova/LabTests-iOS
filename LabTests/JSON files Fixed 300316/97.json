        "They can be found in unusually high numbers at sites of exoparasite infection, e.g., ticks. They also appear in tissues where allergic reactions are occurring and probably contribute to the severity of these reactions. Basophils have protein receptors on their cell surface that bind IgE antibody very tightly. It is the bound IgE antibody that confers a selective response of these cells to environmental substances, for example, pollen proteins."
