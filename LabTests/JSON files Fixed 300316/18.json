        "Albumin is a carbohydrate-free protein, which constitutes 55-65%   of total plasma protein. It maintains oncotic plasma pressure, is   involved in the transport and storage of a wide variety of ligands,   and is a source of endogenous amino acids. Albumin binds and   solubilizes various compounds, including bilirubin, calcium,   long-chain fatty acids, toxic heavy metal ions, and numerous   pharmaceuticals.  Hypoalbuminemia is caused by several factors: impaired synthesis  due either to liver disease (primary) or due to diminished protein   intake (secondary); increased catabolism as a result of tissue   damage and inflammation; malabsorption of amino acids; and increased renal excretion (e.g. nephrotic syndrome)."
