        "Autoantibodies to cytoplasmic neutrophil antigens (ANCA) are of  2 types, distinguished by different patterns of immunofluorescent  staining of human neutrophil substrates:    cANCA produce diffuse cytoplasmic staining of neutrophils  and monocytes and are specific for proteinase 3, a 29 KD  serine protease.    pANCA produce perinuclear staining of neutrophils and are specific  for other neutrophil enzymes including myeloperoxidase (MPO),  elastase, and lactoferrin.  cANCA are found characteristically in the sera of patients with  Wegener's granulomatosis (WG).    pANCA specific for MPO are found in the sera of patients with  systemic vasculitis, most notably in patients with pauci-immun enecrotizing glomerulonephritis."
