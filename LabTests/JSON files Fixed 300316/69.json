        "The infection of and subsequent decrease in the number of T-cells  expressing the CD4 receptor (T helper cells) is the main pathogenic  mechanism of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Progressive  depletion of CD4 T-cells is associated with an increased likelihood  of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and an unfavorable  prognosis.     The United States Public Health Service recommends that CD4   levels be monitored every 3 to 6 months in all HIV-infected persons."

        "When the CD4 count falls below 500 cells/μL, an HIV-positive patient can receive antiretroviral therapy. When the CD4 count falls below 200 cells/μL, an HIV-positive patient is diagnosed with AIDS. When the CD4 count falls below 200 cells/μL, prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jiroveci (formerly carinii) pneumonia is recomended. When the CD4 count falls below 50 cells/μL, prophylaxis against Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare infection is recomended."
