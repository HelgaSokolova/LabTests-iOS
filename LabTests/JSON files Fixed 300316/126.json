        "The diagnostic interpretation may include: Negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy (NIL), Atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) characterized further as either: Atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance or Apical squamous cells, cannot exclude high grade intraepithelial     lesion, Low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL), which includes mild squamous dysplasia (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia I [CINI]) and koilocytotic changes consistent with HPV effect. High grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL), which includes moderate squamous dysplasia (CINII), severe squamous dysplasia (CINIII), and squamous carcinoma in  situ (CINIII), Atypical Glandular Cells. Patients with this diagnosis are at increased risk for a clinically  significant lesion including adenocarcinoma in situ, high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion,  invasive cervical carcinoma, or endometrial carcinoma and should have  appropriate clinical follow up that  may include gynecologic examination, colposcopy, or biopsy. The correlation from cytology to subsequent histologic examination  is imprecise."

        "Squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix is believed to develop in  progressive stages from normal through precancerous (dysplastic)   stages, to carcinoma in situ, and eventually invasive carcinoma. This sequence is felt to develop over  a matter of years in most patients.  The etiology of cervical carcinoma is unknown, but the disease is believed to be related to sexual  activity and possibly sexually  transmitted viral infections such as human papilloma virus (HPV).     Most cervical carcinomas and precancerous conditions occur in the transformation zone  (squamo-columnar junction), therefore, this area  needs to be sampled if optimum results are to be obtained."
