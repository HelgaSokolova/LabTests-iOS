        "Gastrin is a peptide hormone produced by mucosal G cells of the  gastric antrum.  Gastrin half-life is short.  Elimination occurs through peptidase cleavage and renal excretion.    The biological effects are chiefly associated with  promotion of gastric epithelial  cell proliferation and differentiation to acid-secreting cells, direct  promotion of acid secretion, and indirect stimulation of acid production  through histamine release. In addition, gastrin stimulates gastric  motility and release of pepsin and intrinsic factor.     Intraluminal stomach pH is the main factor regulating gastrin  production and secretion. Rising gastric pH levels result in increasing  serum gastrin levels, while falling pH levels are associated with  mounting somatostatin production in gastric D cells. Somatostatin,  in turn, down-regulates gastrin synthesis and release. Other, weaker  factors that stimulate gastrin secretion are gastric distention, protein-  rich foods, and elevated secretin or serum calcium levels.   Gastrin levels may be pathologically increased due to hypersecretion  by gastrin-producing neuroendocrine tumors, chiefly gastrinomas,  25% of which occur as part of the multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1  (MEN 1) syndrome and, rarely, foregut carcinoid tumors. The chronic  hypergastrinemia in these conditions results in continuous gastric acid  oversecretion, leading to recurrent duodenal and gastric ulcers.  Serum gastrin levels may also be elevated in gastric distention due to  gastric outlet obstruction, and in a variety of conditions that lead to  real or functional gastric hypo- or achlorhydria (gastrin is secreted in  an attempted compensatory response to achlorhydria). These include  atrophic gastritis with or without pernicious anemia, a disorder  characterized by destruction of acid-secreting (parietal) cells of the  stomach, gastric dumping syndrome, and surgically excluded gastric  antrum. In atrophic gastritis, the chronic cell-proliferative stimulus of the  secondary hypergastrinemia may contribute to the increased gastric  cancer risk observed in this condition."

        "Achlorhydria is the most common cause of elevated serum gastrin  levels. The most common cause for achlorhydria is treatment of  gastroduodenal ulcers, nonulcer dyspepsia, or gastroesophageal  reflux with proton pump inhibitors (eg,  omeprazole). Other causes of hypo- and achlorhydria include chronic  atrophic gastritis with or without pernicious anemia, gastric ulcer,  gastric carcinoma, and previous surgical or traumatic vagotomy.    If serum B12 levels are significantly low (<150 ng/L), even if the  intrinsic factor blocking antibody tests are negative, a serum gastrin  level above the reference range makes it likely the patient is  nonetheless suffering from pernicious anemia.    Hypergastrinemia with normal or increased gastric acid secretion is  suspicious of a gastrinoma. Gastrin levels <100 pg/mL are observed  so uncommonly in untreated gastrinoma patients with intact upper  gastrointestinal anatomy, as to virtually exclude the diagnosis.   The  majority (>60%) of patients with gastrinoma have very significantly  elevated serum gastrin levels (>400 pg/mL). Levels of >1,000 pg/mL  in a gastric- or duodenal ulcer patient without previous gastric surgery,  on no drugs, who has a basal gastric acid output of >15 mmol/hour  (>5 mmol/hour in patients with prior acid-reducing surgery) are  considered diagnostic of gastrinoma. If there are any doubts about  gastric acid output, an infusion of 0.1 N HCl into the stomach reduces  the serum gastrin in patients with achlorhydria, but not in those with  gastrinoma.   Other conditions that may be associated with hypergastrinemia in  the face of normal or increased gastric acid secretion include  gastric and, rarely, duodenal ulcers, gastric outlet obstruction,  bypassed gastric antrum, and gastric dumping. Occasionally,  diabetes mellitus, autonomic neuropathy with gastroparesis,  pheochromocytoma, rheumatoid arthritis, thyrotoxicosis, and  paraneoplastic syndromes can also result in hypergastrinemia  with normal acid secretion. None of these conditions tends to be  associated with fasting serum gastrin levels >400 pg/mL, and  levels >1,000 pg/mL are virtually never observed."
