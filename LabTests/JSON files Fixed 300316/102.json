        "C-peptide (connecting peptide), a 31-amino-acid polypeptide,  represents the midportion of the proinsulin molecule. Proinsulin  resembles a hairpin structure, with the N-terminal and C-terminal,  which correspond to the A and B chains of the mature insulin molecule,  oriented parallel to each other and linked by disulfide bonds. The  looped portion of the hairpin between the A and B chains is called  C-peptide. During insulin secretion it is enzymatically cleaved off and  cosecreted in equimolar proportion with mature insulin molecules.    Following secretion, insulin and C-peptide enter the portal circulation  and are routed through the liver, where at least 50% of the insulin  binds to receptors, initiates specific hepatic actions (stimulation of  hepatic glucose uptake and suppression of glycogenolysis,  gluconeogenesis, and ketogenesis) and is subsequently degraded.  Most of the insulin molecules that pass through the liver into  the main circulation bind to peripheral insulin receptors, promoting  glucose uptake, while the remaining molecules undergo renal  elimination. Unlike insulin, C-peptide is subject to neither hepatic  nor significant peripheral degradation, but is mainly removed by  the kidneys. As a result, C-peptide has a longer half-life than  insulin (30-35 minutes versus 5-10 minutes) and the molar ratio  of circulating insulin to circulating C-peptide is generally <1,  despite equimolar secretion.   Both serum C-peptide and serum insulin levels are  elevated in renal failure and in disease states that lead to  augmented primary endogenous insulin secretion (eg, insulinoma,  sulfonylurea intoxication). Both also may be raised in any  disease states that cause secondary increases in endogenous  insulin secretion mediated through insulin resistance, primarily  obesity, glucose intolerance, and early type 2 diabetes mellitus, as well as endocrine disorders associated with  hypersecretion of insulin-antagonistic hormones (eg, Cushing's  syndrome, acromegaly).   Failing insulin secretion in type 1 diabetes  and longstanding type 2 diabetes is associated with corresponding  reductions in serum C-peptide levels.    Discordant serum insulin and serum C-peptide abnormalities are  mainly observed in 2 situations: exogenous insulin administration  and in the presence of anti-insulin autoantibodies. Factitious  hypoglycemia due to surreptitious insulin administration results in  appropriate suppression of endogenous insulin and C-peptide  secretion. At the same time, the peripherally administered insulin  bypasses the hepatic first-pass metabolism. In these situations,  insulin levels are elevated and C-peptide levels are decreased.   In patients with insulin antibodies, insulin levels are increased  because of the prolonged half-life of autoantibody-bound insulin."

        "To compare insulin and C-peptide concentrations (ie, insulin  to C-peptide ratio), convert insulin to pmol/L: insulin concentration  (in uIU/mL) x 7.18 = insulin concentration (in pmol/L).    Factitious hypoglycemia due to surreptitious insulin administration  results in elevated serum insulin levels and low or undetectable  C-peptide levels, with a clear reversal of the physiological molar  insulin to C-peptide ratio (≤1) to an insulin to C-peptide ratio of >1.  By contrast, insulin and C-peptide levels are both elevated in  insulinoma and the insulin to C-peptide molar ratio is ≤1.   Sulfonylurea ingestion also is associated with preservation of the  insulin to C-peptide molar ratio of ≤1.   In patients with insulin autoantibodies, the insulin to C-peptide ratio  may be reversed to >1, because of the prolonged half-life of  autoantibody-bound insulin.   Dynamic testing may be necessary in the work-up of hypoglycemia;  the C-peptide suppression test is most commonly employed.  C-peptide levels are measured following induction of hypoglycemia  through exogenous insulin administration. The test relies on the  demonstration of the nonsuppressibility of serum C-peptide levels  within 2 hours following insulin-induced hypoglycemia in patients  with insulinoma.    There are currently no established pediatric reference ranges for  C-peptide."
