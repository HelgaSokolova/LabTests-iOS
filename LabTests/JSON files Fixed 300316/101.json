The menstrual cycle is divided by a mid-cycle surge of both FSH  and LH into a follicular phase and a luteal phase.    FSH appears to control gametogenesis in both males and females."

        "In both males and females, primary hypogonadism results in an  elevation of basal FSH and LH levels.    FSH and LH are generally elevated in primary gonadal failure,  complete testicular feminization syndrome, or precocious puberty  (either idiopathic or secondary to a central nervous system lesion.)  menopause, primary ovarian hypodysfunction, polycystic ovary  disease in females and primary hypogonadism in males.    LH is decreased in primary ovarian hyperfunction in females and  primary hypergonadism in males.    FSH and LH are both decreased in failure of the pituitary or  hypothalamus."
