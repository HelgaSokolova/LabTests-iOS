        "Thyroid hormones regulate a number of developmental,  metabolic, and neural activities throughout the body. The two main  hormones secreted by the thyroid gland are thyroxine, which  contains four atoms of iodine (T4), and triiodothyronine (T3). T3 is  also produced by conversion (deiodination) of T4 in peripheral  tissues. Circulating levels of T4 are much greater than T3 levels,  but T3 is more metabolically active than T4, although its effect is  briefer.  Thyroid hormones circulate primarily bound to carrier proteins   (e.g., thyroid-binding globulin [TBG], albumin); a small fraction  circulates unbound (free). Only the free forms are metabolically  active. While both T3 and T4 are bound to TBG, T3 is bound less   firmly than T4. Total T3 consists of both the bound and unbound   fractions.  In hyperthyroidism both T4 and T3 levels are usually elevated,  but in a small subset of hyperthyroid patients only T3 is elevated  (T3 toxicosis).  In hypothyroidism T4 and T3 levels are decreased. T3 levels  are frequently low in sick or hospitalized euthyroid patients."
