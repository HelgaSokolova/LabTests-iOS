        "Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is present in a number of tissues   including liver, bone, intestine, and placenta. Serum ALP is of   interest in the diagnosis of two main groups of conditions-  hepatobiliary disease and bone disease associated with   increased osteoblastic activity.    A rise in ALP activity occurs with all forms of cholestasis, particularly   with obstructive jaundice. The response of the liver to any form of  biliary tree obstruction is to synthesize more ALP. The main site  of new enzyme synthesis is the hepatocytes adjacent to the biliary  canaliculi.  ALP also is elevated in disorders of the skeletal system that involve   osteoblast hyperactivity and bone remodeling, such as Paget's   disease, rickets and osteomalacia, fractures, and malignant tumors.   Moderate elevation of ALP may be seen in other disorders such as   Hodgkin's disease, congestive heart failure, ulcerative colitis,   regional enteritis, and intra-abdominal bacterial infections."
