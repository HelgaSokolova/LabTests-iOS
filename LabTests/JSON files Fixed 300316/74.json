They are  particularly common in the systemic rheumatic diseases (SRD), which  include lupus erythematosus (LE), discoid LE, drug-induced LE, mixed  connective tissue disease, Sjogren syndrome, scleroderma (systemic  sclerosis), CREST (calcinosis, Raynaud's phenomenon, esophageal  dysmotility, sclerodactyly, telangiectasia) syndrome, polymyositis/  dermatomyositis, and rheumatoid arthritis."

        "A large number of healthy individuals have weakly-positive ANA  results, many of which are likely to be clinical false-positives;  therefore, second-order testing of all positive ANAs yields a very  low percentage of positive results to the specific nuclear antigens.    A positive ANA result at any level is consistent with the diagnosis  of SRD, but a result ≥3.0 U is more strongly associated with SRD  than a weakly-positive result.     Positive ANA results >3.0 U are associated with the presence of  detectable autoantibodies to specific nuclear antigens. The  nuclear antigens are associated with specific diseases (e.g.,  anti-Scl 70 is associated with scleroderma) and can be detected  with second-order testing."
