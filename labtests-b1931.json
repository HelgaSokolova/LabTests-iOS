            "Hyponatremia (low sodium) is a predictable consequence of decreased intake of sodium, particularly that precipitated or complicated by unusual losses of sodium from the gastrointestinal tract (e.g. vomiting and diarrhea), kidneys or sweat glands. Renal loss may be caused by inappropriate choice, dose or use of diuretics; by primary or secondary deficiency of aldosterone and other mineralocorticoids; or by severe polyuria. It is common in metabolic acidosis. Hyponatremia also occurs in nephrotic syndrome, hypoporteinemia, primary and secondary adrenocortical insufficiency and congestive heart failure. Symptoms of hyponatremia are a result of brain swelling and range from weakness to seizures, coma and death.\n",
            "Hypernatremia (high sodium) is often attributable to excessive loss of sodium-poor body fluids. Hypernatremia is often associated with hypercalcemia and hypokalemia and is seen in liver disease, cardiac failure, pregnancy, burns, and osmotic diuresis. Other causes include decreased production of ADH or decreased tubular sensitivity to the hormone (i.e., diabetes insipidus), inappropriate forms of parenteral therapy with saline solutions, or high salt intake without corresponding intake of water. Hypernatremia occurs in dehydration, increased renal sodium conservation in hyperaldosteronism, Cushing's syndrome, and diabetic acidosis. Severe hypernatremia may be associated with volume contraction, lactic acidosis and increased hematocrit. Symptoms of hypernatremia range from thirst to confusion, irritability, seizures, coma and death.\n",

Typically, sodium values less 120 mmol/L result in weakness; values less than 100 mmol/L in bulbar or pseudobulbar palsy; and values between 90 and 105 mmol/L in severe signs and symptoms of neurological impairment. Symptoms associated with hypernatremia depend on the degree of hyperosmolality present."

Ferritin plays a significant role in the absorption, storage, and   release of iron. As the storage form of iron, ferritin remains in the   body tissues until it is needed for erythropoiesis.

Hypoalbuminemia is caused by several factors: impaired synthesis  due either to liver disease (primary) or due to diminished protein   intake (secondary); increased catabolism as a result of tissue   damage and inflammation; malabsorption of amino acids; and increased renal excretion (e.g. nephrotic syndrome)."

            "Bilirubin is one of the most commonly used tests to assess liver function.  Approximately 85% of the total bilirubin produced is derived from  the heme moiety of hemoglobin, while the remaining 15% is produced  from the red blood cell precursors destroyed in the bone marrow  and from the catabolism of other heme-containing proteins. After  production in peripheral tissues, bilirubin is rapidly taken up by   hepatocytes where it is conjugated with glucuronic acid to produce  mono- and diglucuronide, which are excreted in the bile.  A number of inherited and acquired diseases affect one or more of  the steps involved in the production, uptake, storage, metabolism,  and excretion of bilirubin. Bilirubinemia is a frequent and direct result  of these disturbances.  Jaundice can occur as a result of problems at each step in the  metabolic pathway. Disorders may be classified as those due to:  increased bilirubin production (e.g., hemolysis and ineffective  erythropoiesis), decreased bilirubin excretion (e.g., obstruction and  hepatitis), and abnormal bilirubin metabolism (e.g., hereditary and  neonatal jaundice).  The most commonly occurring form of unconjugated  hyperbilirubinemia is that seen in newborns and referred to as  physiological jaundice. Elevated unconjugated bilirubin in the  neonatal period may result in brain damage (kernicterus). Treatment  options are phototherapy and, if severe, exchange transfusion.  The rare genetic disorders, Crigler-Najjar syndromes Type I  and Type II, are caused by a low or absent activity of bilirubin  UDP-glucuronyl-transferase. In Type I, the enzyme activity is  totally absent, the excretion rate of bilirubin is greatly reduced  and the serum concentration of unconjugated bilirubin is greatly  increased. Patients with this disease may die in infancy owing to  the development of kernicterus.  The increased production of bilirubin that accompanies the premature  breakdown of erythrocytes and ineffective erythropoiesis results in  hyperbilirubinemia in the absence of any liver abnormality. In  hepatobiliary diseases of various causes, bilirubin uptake, storage,  and excretion are impaired to varying degrees. Thus, both conjugated  and unconjugated bilirubin is retained and a wide range of abnormal  serum concentrations of each form of bilirubin may be observed.

Calcium ions affect the contractility of the heart and the skeletal  musculature, and are essential for the function of the nervous   system. In addition, calcium ions play an important role in blood   clotting and bone mineralization.  Hypocalcemia is due to the absence or impaired function of the  parathyroid glands or impaired vitamin-D synthesis. Chronic renal   failure is also frequently associated with hypocalcemia due to   decreased vitamin-D synthesis as well as hyperphosphatemia and   skeletal resistance to the action of parathyroid hormone (PTH).   A characteristic symptom of hypocalcemia is latent or manifest   tetany and osteeomalacia.  Hypercalcemia is brought about by increased mobilization of   calcium from the skeletal system or increased intestinal absorption.   The majority of cases are due to primary hyperparathyroidism   (pHPT) or bone metastasis of carcinoma of the breast, prostate,   thyroid gland, or lung. Patients who have pHPT and bone disease,  renal stones or nephrocalcinosis, or other signs or symptoms are  candidates for surgical removal of the parathyroid gland(s).

            "Cholesterol is a steroid with a secondary hydroxyl group. It is synthesized in many types of tissue, but particularly in  the liver and intestinal wall. Approximately 75% of cholesterol is newly synthesized and 25% originates from dietary intake. Normally, the cholesterol in the plasma or serum is 60-80% esterified. Approximately 50-75% of the plasma cholesterol is transported by low density lipoproteins   (LDL) and 15-40% by high density lipoproteins (HDL). Serum cholesterol is elevated in the hereditary hyperlipoproteinemias and in various other metabolic diseases. Moderate to markedly elevated values are also seen in cholestatic liver disease.  Hypercholesterolemia reflects an increase of lipoproteins of 1 or  more specific classes (e.g., beta-LDL, alpha-1 HDL, alpha-2 HDL, or LP-X). Hypercholesterolemia is a risk factor for cardiovascular    disease.  Low levels of cholesterol can be seen in disorders that include hyper-thyroidism, malabsorption, and deficiencies of apolipoproteins."

Noniodinated Tg is actively  transported from thyrocyte cytosol to the thyroid follicular lumen.  At the extracellular apical villae-follicular luminal interface, thyroid  peroxidase (TPO) catalyzes the iodination of tyrosine and  thyronine residues of Tg. This is followed by intramolecular  coupling of pairs of mono- and diiodotyrosines to form thyroid  hormones, predominately thyroxine (T4) or, to lesser degree,  triiodothyronine (T3). The iodinated Tg is stored in the follicular  lumen, forming the colloid. For thyroid hormone release, colloid  is reabsorbed at the apical membrane and proteolyzed.  Iodinated tyrosine residues are deiodinated and recycled for  synthesis of new Tg molecules, while the bulk of T3 and T4  residues are secreted from the basal membrane into the systemic  circulation.  Tg is not secreted into the systemic circulation under normal  circumstances. However, follicular destruction through inflammation  (thyroiditis and autoimmune hypothyroidism), hemorrhage (nodular  goiter), or rapid disordered growth of thyroid tissue, as may be  observed in Graves disease or follicular cell-derived thyroid  neoplasms, can result in leakage of Tg into the blood stream.  This results in the formation of autoantibodies to Tg in some  individuals. The same processes also may result in exposure  of other \"hidden\" thyroid antigens to the immune system, resulting  in autoantibody formation to other thyroid antigens, in particular  TPO. Since anti-Tg and anti-TPO autoantibodies are observed  most frequently in autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto's disease),  they were originally considered to be of possible pathogenic  significance in this disorder.

            "Thyroperoxidase (TPO) is an enzyme involved in thyroid hormone   synthesis, catalyzing the oxidation of iodide on tyrosine residues in   thyroglobulin for the synthesis of triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine   (tetraiodothyronine; T4). TPO is a membrane-associated   hemoglycoprotein expressed only in thyrocytes and is 1 of the most   important thyroid gland antigens.   Disorders of the thyroid gland are frequently caused by autoimmune   mechanisms with the production of autoantibodies. Anti-TPO antibodies   activate complement and are thought to be significantly involved in   thyroid dysfunction and the pathogenesis of hypothyroidism.  The determination of TPO antibody levels is the most sensitive test for   detecting autoimmune thyroid disease (eg, Hashimoto thyroiditis,   idiopathic myxedema, and Graves disease) and detectable   concentrations of anti-TPO antibodies are observed in most patients with  these disorders. The highest TPO antibody levels are observed in   patients suffering from Hashimoto thyroiditis. In this disease, the   prevalence of TPO antibodies is about 90% of cases, confirming the   autoimmune origin of the disease. These autoantibodies also frequently  occur (60%-80%) in the course of Graves disease.  In patients with subclinical hypothyroidism, the presence of TPO   antibodies is associated with an increased risk of developing overt   hypothyroidism. Many clinical endocrinologists use the TPO antibody   test as a diagnostic tool in deciding whether to treat a patient with   subclinical hypothyroidism."

Among the autoantibodies found in autoimmune thyroid disease,   TSHR autoantibodies are most closely associated with disease   pathogenesis. All forms of autoimmune thyrotoxicosis (Graves  disease, Hashitoxicosis, neonatal thyrotoxicosis) are caused by   the production of TSHR-stimulating autoantibodies. These   stimulating autoantibodies, which are also known as long-acting-thyroid-stimulator (LATS) or thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins   (TSI), bind to the receptor and transactivate it, leading to stimulation   of the thyroid gland independent of the normal feedback-regulated   thyrotropin (TSH) stimulation.  Some patients with Graves disease also have TSHR-blocking   antibodies, which do not transactivate the TSHR. The balance   between TSI and TSHR-blocking antibodies, as well as their   individual titers, are felt to be determinants of Graves disease   severity. At least 20% of patients with autoimmune hypothyroidism   also have evidence of either TSHR-blocking antibodies or, rarely, TSI.  The role of the Tg and TPO autoantibodies in relation to disease   development is less well established; they may represent merely   epiphenomena.

TSHR autoantibodies may be detected before autoimmune   thyrotoxicosis becomes biochemically or clinically manifest. Since   none of the treatments for Graves disease are aimed at the underlying   disease process, but rather ablate thyroid tissue or block thyroid   hormone synthesis, TSI may persist after apparent clinical cure.   This is of particular relevance for pregnant women with a history of   Graves disease that was treated with thyroid-ablative therapy. Some   of these women may continue to produce TSI. Since TSI are IgG   antibodies, they can cross the placental barrier causing neonatal   thyrotoxicosis.  While the gold standard for thyroid stimulating immunoglobulins is   the Thyroid-Stimulating Immunoglobulin (TSI), the thyrotropin receptor antibody test has a shorter   turnaround time, less analytical variability, and is less expensive.

Both GH deficiency and mild-to-moderate GH resistance can be treated with recombinant human GH  (rhGH) injections.

It is associated with decreased muscle bulk and increased  cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, but replacement therapy  remains controversial.  Elevated serum IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 levels indicate a sustained over-production of GH, or excessive rhGH therapy.

In the much less common Cyp11A  mutation, andostenedione  levels are elevated to a similar extent as in Cyp21 mutation, and  cortisol is also low, but OHPG is only mildly, if at all, elevated.    In the also very rare 17-alpha-hydroxylase deficiency, androstenedione,  all other androgen-precursors (17-alpha-hydroxypregnenolone,  OHPG, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate [DHEA-S]), androgens  (testosterone, estrone, estradiol), and cortisol are low, while  production of mineral corticoid and its precursors, in particular  progesterone, 11-deoxycorticosterone, and 18-hydroxycorticosterone,  are increased.    The goal of CAH treatment is normalization of cortisol levels and  ideally also of sex-steroid levels. Traditionally, OHPG and urinary  pregnanetriol or total ketosteroid excretion are measured to guide  treatment, but these tests correlate only modestly with androgen  levels. Therefore, androstenedione and testosterone should also  be measured and used to guide treatment modifications. Normal  prepubertal levels may be difficult to achieve, but if testosterone  levels are within the reference range, androstenedione levels of  up to 3.0 nmol/L are usually regarded as acceptable."

            "Lead is a heavy metal commonly found in man's environment that  can be an acute and chronic toxin.    Lead is present in paints manufactured before 1970. Lead was  banned from household paints in 1972 but is still found in paint   produced for non-domestic use and in artistic pigments. Ceramic  products available from non-commercial suppliers (such as local  artists) often contain significant amounts of lead that can be leached  from the ceramic by weak acids such as vinegar and fruit juices.  Lead is found in dirt from areas adjacent to homes painted with  lead-based paints and highways where lead accumulates from  use of leaded gasoline. Use of leaded gasoline has diminished  significantly since the introduction of non-lead gasolines that have  been required in personal automobiles since 1972. Lead is found  in soil near abandoned industrial sites where lead may have been  used. Water transported through lead or lead-soldered pipe will  contain some lead with higher concentrations found in water that is  weakly acidic. Some foods (eg, moonshine distilled in lead pipes)  and some traditional home medicines contain lead.      Exposure to lead  either by ingestion,  inhalation, or dermal contact can cause significant toxicity.    Lead expresses its toxicity by several mechanisms. It avidly inhibits  aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALA-D) and ferrochelatase,  two of the enzymes that catalyze synthesis of heme. Inhibition of  ALA-D and ferrochelatase causes accumulation of delta aminolevulinic  acid in urine and protoporphyrin in erythrocytes, which are markers  for significant lead exposure.    Lead also is an electrophile that avidly forms covalent bonds with  the sulfhydryl group of cysteine in proteins. Thus, proteins in all tissues  exposed to lead will have bound to them.    Keratin in hair contains a high fraction of cysteine relative to other amino  acids. The cysteine residues are cross-linked through lead, thereby  causing the tertiary structure of the protein to change; cells of the nervous  system are particularly susceptible to this effect. Some lead-bound  proteins change their tertiary configuration sufficiently that they become  antigenic; renal tubular cells are particularly susceptible to this effect  because they are exposed to relatively high lead concentrations during  clearance.      A typical diet in the United States contributes approximately 300 ug  of lead per day, of which 1-10% is absorbed; children may absorb as  much as 50% of the dietary intake, and the fraction of lead absorbed  is enhanced by nutritional deficiency. The majority of the daily intake  is excreted in the stool after direct passage through the gastrointestinal  tract. While a significant fraction of the absorbed lead is rapidly  incorporated into bone and erythrocytes, lead ultimately distributes  among all tissues, with lipid-dense tissues such as the central nervous  system particularly sensitive to organic forms of lead. All lead absorbed  is ultimately excreted in the bile or urine. Soft-tissue turnover of lead  occurs within approximately 120 days.    Avoidance of exposure to lead is the treatment of choice. However,  chelation therapy is available to treat severe disease. British anti-Lewisite (BAL) administered intravenously was the classical mode of  chelation therapy. Oral dimercaprol has recently become available  and is being used in the outpatient setting except in the most severe  cases.    Measurement of urine excretion rates either before or after chelation  therapy has been used as an indicator of lead exposure. However,   blood lead analysis has the strongest correlation with toxicity."

The serum calcium level regulates PTH secretion via negative  feedback through the parathyroid calcium sensing receptor (CASR).  Decreased calcium levels stimulate PTH release. Secreted PTH  interacts with its specific type II G-protein receptor, causing rapid  increases in renal tubular reabsorption of calcium and decreased  phosphorus reabsorption. It also participates in long-term  calciostatic functions by enhancing mobilization of calcium from  bone and increasing renal synthesis of 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D,  which, in turn, increases intestinal calcium absorption. In rare inherited  syndromes of parathyroid hormone resistance or unresponsiveness  and in renal failure, PTH release may not increase serum calcium  levels.   Hyperparathyroidism causes hypercalcemia, hypophosphatemia,  hypercalcuria, and hyperphosphaturia. Long-term consequences  are dehydration, renal stones, hypertension, gastrointestinal  disturbances, osteoporosis and sometimes neuropsychiatric  and neuromuscular problems. Hyperparathyroidism is most  commonly primary and caused by parathyroid adenomas. It can  also be secondary in response to hypocalcemia or hyperphosphatemia.

Long-standing secondary hyperparathyroidism can result in  tertiary hyperparathyroidism, which represents the secondary  development of autonomous parathyroid hypersecretion.

Proinsulin  resembles a hairpin structure, with the N-terminal and C-terminal,  which correspond to the A and B chains of the mature insulin molecule,  oriented parallel to each other and linked by disulfide bonds. The  looped portion of the hairpin between the A and B chains is called  C-peptide. During insulin secretion it is enzymatically cleaved off and  cosecreted in equimolar proportion with mature insulin molecules.    Following secretion, insulin and C-peptide enter the portal circulation  and are routed through the liver, where at least 50% of the insulin  binds to receptors, initiates specific hepatic actions (stimulation of  hepatic glucose uptake and suppression of glycogenolysis,  gluconeogenesis, and ketogenesis) and is subsequently degraded.  Most of the insulin molecules that pass through the liver into  the main circulation bind to peripheral insulin receptors, promoting  glucose uptake, while the remaining molecules undergo renal  elimination. Unlike insulin, C-peptide is subject to neither hepatic  nor significant peripheral degradation, but is mainly removed by  the kidneys. As a result, C-peptide has a longer half-life than  insulin (30-35 minutes versus 5-10 minutes) and the molar ratio  of circulating insulin to circulating C-peptide is generally <1,  despite equimolar secretion.   Both serum C-peptide and serum insulin levels are  elevated in renal failure and in disease states that lead to  augmented primary endogenous insulin secretion (eg, insulinoma,  sulfonylurea intoxication). Both also may be raised in any  disease states that cause secondary increases in endogenous  insulin secretion mediated through insulin resistance, primarily  obesity, glucose intolerance, and early type 2 diabetes mellitus, as well as endocrine disorders associated with  hypersecretion of insulin-antagonistic hormones (eg, Cushing's  syndrome, acromegaly).   Failing insulin secretion in type 1 diabetes  and longstanding type 2 diabetes is associated with corresponding  reductions in serum C-peptide levels.    Discordant serum insulin and serum C-peptide abnormalities are  mainly observed in 2 situations: exogenous insulin administration  and in the presence of anti-insulin autoantibodies. Factitious  hypoglycemia due to surreptitious insulin administration results in  appropriate suppression of endogenous insulin and C-peptide  secretion. At the same time, the peripherally administered insulin  bypasses the hepatic first-pass metabolism. In these situations,  insulin levels are elevated and C-peptide levels are decreased.   In patients with insulin antibodies, insulin levels are increased  because of the prolonged half-life of autoantibody-bound insulin."

            "Gastrin is a peptide hormone produced by mucosal G cells of the  gastric antrum.  Gastrin half-life is short.  Elimination occurs through peptidase cleavage and renal excretion.    The biological effects are chiefly associated with  promotion of gastric epithelial  cell proliferation and differentiation to acid-secreting cells, direct  promotion of acid secretion, and indirect stimulation of acid production  through histamine release. In addition, gastrin stimulates gastric  motility and release of pepsin and intrinsic factor.     Intraluminal stomach pH is the main factor regulating gastrin  production and secretion. Rising gastric pH levels result in increasing  serum gastrin levels, while falling pH levels are associated with  mounting somatostatin production in gastric D cells. Somatostatin,  in turn, down-regulates gastrin synthesis and release. Other, weaker  factors that stimulate gastrin secretion are gastric distention, protein-  rich foods, and elevated secretin or serum calcium levels.   Gastrin levels may be pathologically increased due to hypersecretion  by gastrin-producing neuroendocrine tumors, chiefly gastrinomas,  25% of which occur as part of the multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1  (MEN 1) syndrome and, rarely, foregut carcinoid tumors. The chronic  hypergastrinemia in these conditions results in continuous gastric acid  oversecretion, leading to recurrent duodenal and gastric ulcers.  Serum gastrin levels may also be elevated in gastric distention due to  gastric outlet obstruction, and in a variety of conditions that lead to  real or functional gastric hypo- or achlorhydria (gastrin is secreted in  an attempted compensatory response to achlorhydria). These include  atrophic gastritis with or without pernicious anemia, a disorder  characterized by destruction of acid-secreting (parietal) cells of the  stomach, gastric dumping syndrome, and surgically excluded gastric  antrum. In atrophic gastritis, the chronic cell-proliferative stimulus of the  secondary hypergastrinemia may contribute to the increased gastric  cancer risk observed in this condition."

The diagnosis of APS requires one or more of the above  mentioned clinical findings plus positive test results for phospholipid  antibodies (≥40 GPL or MPL) or positive tests for a lupus"

Again, if the changes in pH are mirrored by the changes in the HCO3-level, then the cause of the acid-base imbalance is probably metabolic.  Just to a note about base excess. A base excess (positive value) indicates an excess of base in the body and so mirrors a raised HCO3- level (metabolic alkalosis). A base deficit (negative value) indicates a lack of base in the body and so mirrors a reduced HCO3- level (metabolic acidosis).  One further thing to look for is compensatory changes. This is to be expected because the body wants to bring the pH level back to normal. Remember that respiratory compensation occurs quickly whereas metabolic compensation can take longer to occur."

These therapeutic  effects are produced through a network of direct and indirect interactions upon  the myocardium, blood vessels, and the autonomic nervous system.     Digoxin is well absorbed after oral administration and is widely distributed to  tissues, especially the heart, kidney, and liver. After oral  administration, there is an early rise in serum concentration. Equilibration of  serum and tissue levels occurs at approximately 6-8 hours. For this reason,  blood specimens for digoxin analysis should be drawn at least 6-8 hours after  drug administration. Digoxin is excreted primarily in the urine.  The  average elimination half-life is 36-40 hours, but may be considerably prolonged  in those with renal disease, causing digoxin accumulation and toxicity.     Symptoms of digoxin toxicity often mimic the cardiac arrhythmia's for which the  drug was originally prescribed (e.g. heart block and heart failure).   Other typical symptoms of toxicity include gastrointestinal effects, including anorexia,  nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhea, and neuropsychologic symptoms,  such as fatigue, malaise, dizziness, clouded or blurred vision, visual and  auditory hallucination, paranoid ideation, and depression.  Toxicity of  digoxin may reflect several factors:  the drug has a narrow therapeutic window (a  very small difference exists between therapeutic and toxic tissue levels);  individuals vary in their ability  to  metabolize and respond to digoxin; absorption of various oral forms of  digoxin may vary over a 2-fold range;  susceptibility to digitalis toxicity apparently  increases with age."

            "Phenytoin is the drug of choice to treat  and prevent tonic-clonic and psychomotor seizures. If phenytoin alone will not  prevent seizure activity, coadministration with phenobarbital is usually  effective.     Initial therapy with phenytoin is started at doses of 100 mg/day to 300 mg/day  for adults or 4 mg/kg/day for children.

Oral bioavailability ranges  from 80% to 95% and is diet-dependent.     Phenytoin exhibits zero-order pharmacokinetics; the rate of clearance of the  drug is dependent upon the concentration of drug present. Therefore, phenytoin  does not have a classical half-life like other drugs, since it varies with  blood concentration. At a blood concentration of 15 µg/mL, approximately half  the drug in the patient's body will be eliminated in 20 hours. As the blood  concentration drops, the rate at which phenytoin is excreted increases.     Phenytoin has a volume of distribution of 0.65 L/kg, and is highly protein  bound (90%), mostly to albumin.     Phenytoin pharmacokinetics are significantly affected by a number of other  drugs. Phenytoin and phenobarbital are frequently co-administered. Induction of  the cytochrome P450 enzyme system by phenobarbital will increase the rate at  which phenytoin is metabolized and cleared. At steady-state, enzyme induction  will increase the rate of clearance of phenytoin such that the dose must be  increased approximately 30% to maintain therapeutic levels.     Uremia has a similar effect on phenytoin protein binding. Dosage must be  reduced to avoid toxicity.     The free phenytoin level is the best indicator of adequate therapy.

Identification of  known positive cases with the nitrate test ranges from as low as 40%, when  little bladder incubation occurred, to as high as approximately 80%, when a  minimum of 4 hours of bladder incubation occurred.   Negative results may occur when 1) urinary tract infections are caused  by organisms that do not contain reductase to convert nitrate to nitrite, 2)  when urine has not been retained in the bladder long enough (4 hours or more)  for reduction of nitrate to nitrite to occur, or 3) when dietary nitrate is  absent, even if organisms containing reductase are present and bladder  incubation is ample."
